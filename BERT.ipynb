I make exceptions for book related platforms like Reddit or Bookstagram. It’s been 3 years and I don’t miss a single thing about FB.-buy cheap used books or use the library. That way you can sift through a wide variety of books for minimal monies. Some used book shops have mint condition books for $4.-join in on the r/52book subreddit. That’s what motivated me to start reading more and it’s been a lot of fun over the years. I found great recommendations and had some really good interactions with other Redditors                -always carry a book with you. You never know when you’ll find an extra 15 minutes to read. And all those little chunks really add up. I did that less in 2021 and you can see the above results.              Those are my main bookish habits that keep me reading at a high rate.

I could very much see it run the risk of  boiling literary analysis down to nothing but a checklist of actionable steps and removing any kind of ambiguities (and thus potential) from literary texts.While there are certain protocols to follow in literary studies, the craft is much more free form than, say, running a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, it is a matter of being receptive to the nuances of a text - and to bring one\\'s understanding of (literary) theory and history into dialogue with these nuances. (I am, of course, oversimplifying.)Thus, building a personal repertoire of literary theories and a solid understanding of (literary) histories might be one of the best bets to become better at critically engaging with literature. Building this repertoire, in turn, is probably best achieved through reading - and discussing what one has read.When it comes to the former, you can find a few recommendations in the following:If you want to dip your toes into some pop-literary studies first, you might want to try something like Thomas C. Foster\\'s *How to Read Literature Like A Prof*, which u/pm_me_poemsplease recommended in a similar context.Another great way to get a first feel for almost any academic field are Oxford University Press\\'s Very Short Introductions - in this case Jonathan Culler\\'s Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction.You could also have a look at general introductory textbooks, like Mario Klarer\\'s *An Introduction to Literary Studies,* or at textbooks focusing specifically on literary theory, such as erry Eagleton\\'s *Literary Theory: An Introduction* and Peter Barry\\'s *Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory*. In case you would prefer to watch a lecture on the topic, there is always [Yale\\'s Open Course on Literary Theory](https://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300).Finally, if you want to dive straight into the deep end, you could have a look at Cambridge University Press\\'s extensive list of *Cambridge Companions to X* and *Cambridge Histories of Y*, where X and Y are something like \"the Victorian novel\" and \"American Literature.\"I hope some of this helps and I am sorry I couldn\\'t offer any more open-source resources.If you\\'ve got any questions, feel free to ask!EDIT: You might also want to check out r/AskLiteraryStudies. :)\\n': (0,\n",
