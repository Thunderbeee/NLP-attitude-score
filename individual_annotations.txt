500	Shuyao Zhou	3	Please post recommendation requests in /r/suggestmeabook or the weekly thread. You might also like /r/askliterarystudies.
501	Shuyao Zhou	1	Thanks for the Elton update! :) 
502	Shuyao Zhou	2	I cannot really answer your question which though I think is very interesting I wouldn't dare give my uninformed opinion about. I would recommend trying r/AskLiteraryStudies, they can probably provide you with tons of opinions, theories, academic papers maybe, tips on how to proceed etc. Best of luck!
503	Shuyao Zhou	1	Won't get any newreaders on that sub, and a huge part of the fun of rewatchs/reads is seeing first timers reactions
504	Shuyao Zhou	3	Some months back I asked this community for recommended reading on the comics medium (which I naively referred to as "graphic novel" medium at the time, which is apparently distasteful nowadays). I got [a lot of really great answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/kqf1sn/recommended_reading_on_the_graphic_novel_medium/)—I wonder if any of those comments will be helpful to you?
505	Shuyao Zhou	1	Same. I saw a lot of posts in the r/52book sub of people standing next to the stack of books that they read in 2021. I can’t believe so many keep all their books!

507	Shuyao Zhou	3	 Marion and Shiva Stone are twin brothers born of a secret union between a beautiful Indian nun and a brash British surgeon at a mission hospital in Addis Ababa. Orphaned by their mother’s death in childbirth and their father’s disappearance, bound together by a preternatural connection and a shared fascination with medicine, the twins come of age as Ethiopia hovers on the brink of revolution. Yet it will be love, not politics—their passion for the same woman—that will tear them apart and force Marion, fresh out of medical school, to flee his homeland. He makes his way to America, finding refuge in his work as an intern at an underfunded, overcrowded New York City hospital. When the past catches up to him—nearly destroying him—Marion must entrust his life to the two men he thought he trusted least in the world: the surgeon father who abandoned him and the brother who betrayed him.
508	Shuyao Zhou	1	I love good histI love good history stories when it comes to nonfiction for the most part, and if it's the right author it reads like fiction almost with the added layer of true story to it. I read nonfiction to learn and fiction to enjoy or stimulate my imagination. I've also been listening to audio books on hikes, in the car, or doing chores which gives me more chances to fill me head! Definitely, I think Goodreads is just what I needed.That's probably a healthy balance of gaming, honestly. I appreciate the fact you tend to commit to one game at a time and finish it; I could be a lot better with that, especially with TV shows. At least once you make the decision you follow through with it! 😅 I've heard some good things about Ori, and the art looked really nice for it!Wow that's a hard question, now that I think about it! Sorry to put you on the spot like that. If I'm being honest, I'd probably have to say Minecraft was my favorite indie game I've ever played. It's massive now, but when my friends and I all bought it, it was only sort of recently into beta and wasn't owned by Microsoft yet. Some of my friends had started playing it in alpha even. We were fresh into high school, so no cars yet, and we put a ton of hours into like 2 servers over the course of 2 years. The fact that I was hanging out with my friends and the game was regularly being updated to add new things for us to do and explore and building massive projects together late into the night are memories I'm pretty fond of. Minecraft was a really fun gaming experience that I don't think will ever truly be replicated for me in adulthood. I would say, in general, PC gaming in high school with my friends amounted to my favorite times on video games - we would sometimes cop random cheap games on Steam sales too, and we played a lot of Team Fortress 2 and Payday 2. One of my top gaming experiences happened in Skyrim though, and playing through Shadow of the Colossus (which I can't recommend enough) on PS2 was an incredible single player experience!Well anyways, I could go on, but I don't want to take up all your time lol. It's been a real pleasure talking with you, and thank you so much for your suggestions on booklists and Goodreads! I will definitely get some use out of it.

509	Shuyao Zhou	1	Imagine my surprise when (haven't completed the story yet, so most enemies don't go above 6) I was doing the bookclub quests and got to the part where you get ambushed. Had my bow out since I wasn't expecting it. Lvl 9 renegades, one boss one with a 2 hander. I have all inhibs with max stam and rest in HP. 2hits later I was dead. Yet he tanks 10 hits from my almost 450dmg electro sword. God bless chain electricity stuns though, cause fighting him in that tiny room was slightly difficult.
510	Shuyao Zhou	3	[link] Anna Petrovna Kern name after second marriage: Markova-Vinogradskaya was a Russian socialite and memoirist, best known as the addressee of what is probably the best known love poem in the Russian language, written by Aleksandr Pushkin in 1825. Anna was born in Oryol at the mansion of her grandfather, the local governor. She was brought up in Lubny in the Poltava Governorate (present-day Ukraine). On 8 January 1817 she was married by her parents to the 56-year-old General Kern, whom she professed to detest thoroughly.
511	Shuyao Zhou	2	Every month I try and just pick what I feel like reading \*within\* these categories -   1-2 books for my Reading Around the World Challenge1 book for my bookclub1 classic I haven't read1 light and easy romcom type book1 Literary fiction1 from a series I'm reading  After that I just read whatever suits me until the new month.
512	Shuyao Zhou	2	She sounds generous. The best. Maybe she needs to come join bookclub one of these days
513	Shuyao Zhou	1	Probably better off going to r/suggestmeabook or r/whattoreadwhen.
514	Shuyao Zhou	3	Whether we are dealing with a rude clerk, our child saying, "That's not fair!," our spouse ignoring us, or an uncooperative co-worker, in our struggle to respond effectively, we often become defensive - sometimes without even realizing it. Despite good intentions, we can become manipulative and controlling, even with those we love most. 
515	Shuyao Zhou	3	After a nuclear World War III has destroyed most of the globe, the few remaining survivors in southern Australia await the radioactive cloud that is heading their way and bringing certain death to everyone in its path. Among them is an American submarine captain struggling to resist the knowledge that his wife and children in the United States must be dead. Then a faint Morse code signal is picked up, transmitting from somewhere near Seattle, and Captain Towers must lead his submarine crew on a bleak tour of the ruined world in a desperate search for signs of life. On the Beach is a remarkably convincing portrait of how ordinary people might face the most unimaginable nightmare.
516	Shuyao Zhou	1	Always happy to hear more people chime in! I know a big thing for all the contributors is knowing that people are actually reading and using posts/booklists/work. A little thank you goes a long way!Always happy to hear suggestions to. *Generally* we try to keep the bulk of recommendations from flaired members because it gives us a good idea of who's expertise is suggesting it. Not *super* sure what other avenues for volunteer work there is, other then as your using it let us know if you come across any problems. Broken links, typos, stuff like that.
517	Shuyao Zhou	2	If you're unfamiliar with Zen Pencils [link], I strongly recommend reading more about those comics and their background - [link]There is a lot of good material on there.
518	Shuyao Zhou	1	My last post: [link]The last two books were:* House of Hades, by Rick Riordan.* All Quiet on the Western Front, by Enrich Maria Remarque. The last book was absolutely disheartening, and I loved it!
519	Shuyao Zhou	3	*You know what writers esteem by knowing about writers and finding out what influenced them most.* There's no reason people esteem most what they've been influenced by. You can take ideas and methods from a book all while thinking that the use of those ideas and methods ultimately don't add up to much in the original book. *How many books have been written about Ulysses, Bleak House, Tristram Shandy? Lots.* It's not necessarily writers writing these books about Ulysses etc.? It's scholars of these books or their period, which is a distinctly different group, writing about these authors for perhaps entirely different reasons; *How many writers clearly take influences from those novels and talk about them in interviews or things that they write?* But again, influence is more a matter of the potential of some idea or thing author A did to being used by author B; author A may have achieved something brilliant except his ideas and methods are not transferable to most other kinds of books, or he may have use a brilliant idea or technique abysmally poorly in a similarly poor book, and that idea or technique gets used widely and influences legions of writers.
520	Shuyao Zhou	1	They're probably gunna remove your post per the rules in the side bar, so try the weekly suggestion thread or any of these related subs where you might find recommendations ([from my great big list of book realted subs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnZz_HTCD_pNdEw4cGdjODhkUGQ0REpXSERXa2ZjSlE&amp;usp=sharing)):
521	Shuyao Zhou	2	I use a books multi, so I've got a lot of less active subs on it. Apart from audiobook subs, free ebook subs, and ones already mentioned, here are the rest of my (relatively inactive) book subs:/r/bookdiscussion/r/booktomovie/r/epicpoems/r/literature/r/mythsandlegends/r/neilgaiman/r/robolit/r/truebooks/r/weirdlit/r/wodehouse
522	Shuyao Zhou	2	I love "Julián is a Mermaid" and "Julián at the Wedding" by Jessica Love, as well as "My Shadow Is Pink" by Scott Stuart. The author who wrote "Ada Twist, Scientist!" has also written lots of books that aren't explicitly about gender, but they feature children defying gender norms and exercising their independence and talents.Social Justice Books also has some really great book lists that cover lots of different topics. Here's their list of recommended books pertaining to Gender Identity: [link]
523	Shuyao Zhou	2	This really isnt kindle related. Likely have better luck with:/r/books /r/bookdiscussion /r/readalong
524	Shuyao Zhou	2	I'm not sure if such a website or program exists and - as a literary scholar by training - I am somewhat skeptical that such an approach would do a good job at teaching the necessary skills to critically engage with literature. I could very much see it run the risk of  boiling literary analysis down to nothing but a checklist of actionable steps and removing any kind of ambiguities (and thus potential) from literary texts.While there are certain protocols to follow in literary studies, the craft is much more free form than, say, running a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, it is a matter of being receptive to the nuances of a text - and to bring one's understanding of (literary) theory and history into dialogue with these nuances. (I am, of course, oversimplifying.)Thus, building a personal repertoire of literary theories and a solid understanding of (literary) histories might be one of the best bets to become better at critically engaging with literature. Building this repertoire, in turn, is probably best achieved through reading - and discussing what one has read.When it comes to the former, you can find a few recommendations in the following:If you want to dip your toes into some pop-literary studies first, you might want to try something like Thomas C. Foster's *How to Read Literature Like A Prof*, which u/pm_me_poemsplease recommended in a similar context.Another great way to get a first feel for almost any academic field are Oxford University Press's Very Short Introductions - in this case Jonathan Culler's Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction.You could also have a look at general introductory textbooks, like Mario Klarer's *An Introduction to Literary Studies,* or at textbooks focusing specifically on literary theory, such as erry Eagleton's *Literary Theory: An Introduction* and Peter Barry's *Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory*. In case you would prefer to watch a lecture on the topic, there is always [Yale's Open Course on Literary Theory](https://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300).Finally, if you want to dive straight into the deep end, you could have a look at Cambridge University Press's extensive list of *Cambridge Companions to X* and *Cambridge Histories of Y*, where X and Y are something like "the Victorian novel" and "American Literature."I hope some of this helps and I am sorry I couldn't offer any more open-source resources.If you've got any questions, feel free to ask!EDIT: You might also want to check out r/AskLiteraryStudies. :)
525	Shuyao Zhou	1	My slump was 2020. The pandemic and losing my job because of it.  The isolation.  Should have been reading more but read way less.  /r/52book got me out of my slump.  Just having that goal with other people.  Honestly it’s my favorite sub of all.  Love seeing what everyone is reading and random recommendations.  With no expectations on goals, you don’t have to read 52 or start at any specific time. 
526	Shuyao Zhou	2	Next level reminds me of extreme movie.
527	Shuyao Zhou	2	No shame in your goal. Everyone is different.I also enjoy my own internal monologue, while reading, and it slows me down. So, I completely understand. Sometimes, my internal monologue helps me understand the book, even more.I look forward to seeing more of you.Side note, this would be more appropriate for the [current annual  Introduction thread.][link]
528	Shuyao Zhou	3	Like they are lacking empathy? So the society of Omelas is contingent upon the unhappiness of one person, and the ones who don't walk away from Omelas lack empathy for the one child that has to suffer.It sounds like alienation, in a broad sense, which is taken up by many authors differently. Marx identifies four varieties of alienation under capitalism, one of which is alienation from other people. For Marx the concept of alienation from your fellow "man", and/or a conception called the species-being, is going to hinge dramatically upon how people relate to each other, and how people relate to commodities under capitalism.For other authors, the concept of alienation shows up with relation to Alienation of people from each other regarding the subject of race and race relations; men from women on the basis of perceived differences along genders, and so on. You might get a better, and more precise answer, from r/askliterarystudies as there are a lot of works interpreting Le Guin literarily. However one video discussion I think is somewhat relevant, is this one from Jeremy Rifkin. He suggests that utopia lacks empathy, and that empathy is anti utopian. Since you're asking about a classic utopian fiction with I think this is a reasonable way to go.  
529	Shuyao Zhou	2	May have better luck in a recommendation based subreddit:
530	Shuyao Zhou	1	Read 52 books this year!  Try to read 1 non fiction a month and 1 classic a month.  r/52book
531	Shuyao Zhou	3	r/suggestmeabookr/EliversusMonsterCityr/booksuggestionsr/52bookr/joeledger
532	Shuyao Zhou	1	Tordotcom specializes in more literary/envelope-pushing sff than some of the other publishing imprints (compare Baen, for instance). From my experience making coming-soon lists and such, women, nb authors, and men of color are more active in writing this type of fantasy, whereas a lot of the big names writing sff that are white guys often operate in more "traditional" SFF. Generalizations, of course, but I think it's worth noting.
533	Shuyao Zhou	3	Sabrina the Teenage Witch is a comic book series published by Archie Comics about the adventures of a fictional American teenager named Sabrina Spellman. Sabrina was created by writer George Gladir and artist Dan DeCarlo, and first appeared in Archie's Madhouse #22 (cover-dated Oct. 1962). Storylines of the character at elementary-school-age also appear under the title "Sabrina -- That Cute Little Witch" in almost all of the Little Archie comics.
534	Shuyao Zhou	1	Welcome to r/bookclub. Glaf to have you on board for Wuthering Heights :)
535	Shuyao Zhou	2	The people who do hermeneutics might have a word for it, but I think you're probably better off trying /r/AskLiteraryStudies, this seems more up their alley.
536	Shuyao Zhou	2	I think some of the heavy hitters in r/52book balance out the nonreaders.
537	Shuyao Zhou	2	I naturally gravitate toward female protagonist type stories but am actively looking to expand into other genres and am finding they are equally if not more engaging. I might even try to pare down my amount of nonfiction reading if I can find enough enthralling nonfiction. I’ve been combing through npr booklists and it seems to help with this.
538	Shuyao Zhou	2	You remind me of the movie "Intermission" from 2003
539	Shuyao Zhou	3	These surveys were done only two years after circumcision. Both tacked on to the end of an HIV study. So the people were pressured into getting a circumcision for HIV benefits and then asked if there was a detriment. Surely you see the conflict of:1) Being pressured to undergo a procedure for health benefits, and *then* being asked if there’s downsides.2) These are 5 point surveys, a pretty terrible way to note the complexity and nuances of sexual pleasure.3) With a language barrier to boot.4) The skin and glans were protected for 20+ years, and then exposed for only up to 2 years. Leading to,5) Applying data from adult circumcisions to newborn circumcisions is overextending the data. That’s two years and one year of glans and foreskin remnant exposure compared to ~16-18 years for newborn circumcision before their sex life *starts*.
540	Shuyao Zhou	2	This is my favorite book list: [link]
541	Shuyao Zhou	2	What really helped for me personally was finding some social obligations to get reading again by joining a bookclub with a bunch of friends. Of course it may not be for everybody but it really helped me.
542	Shuyao Zhou	3	A branch for the 18th century might be the Age of the Novel/Rise of the Novel. Also rather than Age of Pope I would consider it more appropriately described as the Age of Satire. Early C18 is also usually referred to as the Enlightenment Period rather than Classical/Augustan.Also, r/askliterarystudies would probably be a useful resource for this project.
543	Shuyao Zhou	2	Making jewelry, painting, listening to podcasts, audiobooks as well, adult coloring books, hiking, paddleboarding, board games, roadtrips, dinner parties, music( EDM to Indie to 80s rock)
544	Shuyao Zhou	1	Here's a sneak peek of /r/bookclub using the [top posts][link] of the year!
545	Shuyao Zhou	3	Memoirs of the Twentieth Century is an early work of speculative fiction by Irish writer Samuel Madden. This 1733 epistolary novel takes the form of a series of diplomatic letters written in 1997 and 1998. The work is a satire perhaps modeled after Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels published seven years before. Madden was an Anglican clergyman, and the book is focused on the dangers of Catholicism and Jesuits, depicting a future where they dominate.
546	Shuyao Zhou	3	There's no one sub for all, but plenty of subject-specific ones:    r/Ijustwatched   r/iwatchedanoldmovie r/IWatchedAnOldSeries r/books
547	Shuyao Zhou	2	I wrote this in r/books, i don't know why now it is in r/suggestmeabook
548	Shuyao Zhou	1	Joining r/52book helped me.  2020 was bad and even though I was unemployed I didn’t really read.  Then in 2021 joining 52 book and having a goal, seeing what other people were reading and suggesting lit a fire and I got to 52 last year.  Hope you join us.  One fave I recommend to everyone - Project Hail Mary.  It’s amaze!!
549	Shuyao Zhou	3	These are all of the ones I had on my multi that weren't on your list:* /r/52book* /r/audiobooks [link]
550	Shuyao Zhou	2	That's the beauty of the bookclub, they join, he tells them what it says and why that makes liberals bad, and then they can claim to have read it without having to read. It's the perfect system.
551	Shuyao Zhou	1	You just brought back some horrible memories from that Vaastu shaastra movie. Was that the movie? The one where a hand keeps coming out from the ground? Fucking creepy.
552	Shuyao Zhou	1	What / bookclub?
553	Shuyao Zhou	2	To be fair, the only poets he thinks are good are ["Homer, Virgil, Dante, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Goethe and maybe Dickinson"][link], so it's a pretty high bar (especially since you assume he must have read them in their original languages to make such a pronouncement). [He's also 19][link], so there is still a little hope that he'll grow out of it.
554	Shuyao Zhou	1	As for alternatives, I don't go here much because I find this sub grating (for reasons that have nothing to do with the moderation), and like, there are SO MANY alternatives out there already. There's /r/writers, /r/PubTips, r/publishing, /r/storyandstyle, /r/YAwriters, /r/fantasywriters, /r/FanFiction, and that's just the writing subs I can keep up with. /r/BetaReaders and /r/DestructiveReaders have occasional craft threads. Tons of reading-focused subs - /r/Fantasy, /r/literature, /r/TrueLit, /r/horrorlit - have a community of writers and regular writing discussion in weekly threads, regular threads, or even dedicated threads. There really isn't a dearth of writing content on this site. Really. I would say there's writing content for any level and any preference. I would frankly feel silly complaining.
555	Shuyao Zhou	3	Please explain in strictly medical terms why this is happening to me: [link].
556	Shuyao Zhou	2	/r/BookDiscussion is a little quiet but does exist.
557	Shuyao Zhou	2	m just trying to save this community from the vexatious experience of reading "Master and Margarita". What a load of hogwash. r/AskLiteraryStudies, you've been warned.
558	Shuyao Zhou	2	the posts keeps getting deleted there so just wanted to post in some popular book sub. and r/bookdiscussion is too small. I'll delete it after some time
559	Shuyao Zhou	1	I fuckin swear ask literary studies is the newest argbuks.
560	Shuyao Zhou	1	[I definitely am][link]😅
561	Shuyao Zhou	1	Agreed the first few chapters were slow but now i am super invested in the David, Charles, Edward triangle. Be sure to tell us what you thought on the [first check-in][link] especially if you will zip off without us ;)
562	Shuyao Zhou	1	Hey there, I'd recommend also asking this question in r/AskLiteraryStudies as Pop Culture is an established area of study within the discipline and has been so for some time now.
563	Shuyao Zhou	1	Nice! What are you reading?  Are you subbed to /r/52book ?
564	Shuyao Zhou	2	An X-Men movie?
565	Shuyao Zhou	3	What unites such diverse academic fields as music composition, theory, musicology, cognition, literary studies, neuropsychology, economics, anatomy, genetics, bioinformatics, political science, geopolitics, pharmacology and anthropology? A terminological non-issue that respondents have been telling you for three years is easily resolved by opening a dictionary.
566	Shuyao Zhou	1	Hmm, 518 subscriptions, no wonder I never see most of these on the front page.
567	Shuyao Zhou	1	Great, Rupert's going to stop his newreaders from talking and stop publishing his birdcage liners.
568	Shuyao Zhou	1	You probably want /r/askliterarystudies because ain't none of this stuff in the Bible
569	Shuyao Zhou	2	Charlotte Mason inspired curricula are classical; Ambleside Online is a completely free option with booklists and guides for a secular Charlotte Mason-style curriculum. It’s a lot of work on the parents’ end to gather all the books and set everything up, but it’s a great education model that encourages reading and critical thinking. It’s definitely not just a pile of workbooks to hand the kid to go through, but the prep is worth it. We love it.
570	Shuyao Zhou	1	There’s r/52book I spend most of my time over there lol I’m not aware of any prompts they have? Cause like the point/goal is to read a book a week. Some people pair 52 book challenge with an A-Z challenge or the PopSugar challenge. Never heard of it is a club. Usually just a challenge or that subreddit
571	Shuyao Zhou	1	Oh nice idea. I found this thread: [link]So i think i’ll join through there
572	Shuyao Zhou	1	For your readers advisory do you just stay up to date on booklists? I don't do it at all in my special library but sometimes when I sub in public I want to still be able to suggest some good stuff.
573	Shuyao Zhou	2	This would be a better post in /r/Criticaltheory or /r/Askliterarystudies than here to be honest.
574	Shuyao Zhou	1	It's like r/52book, but for quilts!
575	Shuyao Zhou	3	You might get more discussion at r/books or r/bookdiscussion
576	Shuyao Zhou	1	Wait, just so I'm understanding correctly, you're unhappy with /r/literature? May I inquire as to why?But back to your request (warning, I'm ,not subscribed to any of these, I just know about them and am assuming that you are seeking discussion) you might check out **/r/bookclub**. They also have niche clubs if your are feeling particularly...niche-y (y'know?). /r/SF_Book_Club  /r/Fantasy_Bookclub  /r/scifi_bookclub  /r/playclub  /r/science_bookclub  /r/nonfiction_bookclub  /r/history_bookclub  /r/KindleBookClubThere's /r/bookdiscussion, but the last post was four months ago. There's also /r/booksandtea which is very small but has the possibility to become active. I don't know... Maybe we need... A *new* one. A *true* one...
577	Shuyao Zhou	2	if you check out /r/52book you will see a dedicated few who break 100+ books in a single year.  With people who dedicate that much time to reading it definitely helps bring the average up.
578	Shuyao Zhou	1	Why do none of you guys buy books from your booklists 🙁
579	Shuyao Zhou	3	To Have or to Be? is a 1976 book by psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, in which he differentiates between having and being. It was originally published in the World Perspectives book series edited by Ruth Nanda Anshen for Harper &amp; Row publishing firm. Fromm writes that modern society has become materialistic and prefers "having" to "being". 
580	Shuyao Zhou	1	2021 was the year I tried audiobooks for the first time. But I just needed to have the physical copies too. It's a bad habit I'm trying to overcome. I have had some REALLY good reads this year. I rated them in tiers. (I regret putting the book "Shout" in good and not great) I hope this answers your question.
581	Shuyao Zhou	1	The fact that so many are replying to me unironically with the take that "leftists need to stop making problematic jokes that give the right ammunition" ummm you know what gives the right WAY MORE ammunition??? Wokescolds. Have fun trying to build a strong left when it's just a very small bookclub where no one can make jokes. How the fuck have we already forgotten the gamergate era??
582	Shuyao Zhou	3	**[Germinal (novel)][link]Germinal is the thirteenth novel in Émile Zola's twenty-volume series Les Rougon-Macquart. Often considered Zola's masterpiece and one of the most significant novels in the French tradition, the novel – an uncompromisingly harsh and realistic story of a coalminers' strike in northern France in the 1860s – has been published and translated in over one hundred countries and has additionally inspired five film adaptations and two television productions. Germinal was written between April 1884 and January 1885. It was first serialized between November 1884 and February 1885 in the periodical Gil Blas, then in March 1885 published as a book.

586	Shuyao Zhou	1	Happy Cake Day 🍰I'm reading a about Modernism and Google came up with this [this][link] from 7 years ago. Thanks kind stranger for the info.
587	Shuyao Zhou	1	Here's a sneak peek of /r/bookdiscussion using the [top posts][link] of the year!
588	Shuyao Zhou	1	My bookclub is currently reading it!
589	Shuyao Zhou	2	{{The Power}} by Naomi Alderman. Read it in my bookclub and it generated a decent discussion.  Not an exact fit for superheroes but more along the lines of gaining superpowers
590	Shuyao Zhou	1	Another reason to ditch spiro for me is to reduce the amount of pills I’m popping for liver/kidney health, and to be able to afford an ADHD prescription on top of hrt.
591	Shuyao Zhou	2	AFAIK UK and European PhD applicants typically already have a masters level degree in the field, and you'll be expected to have a thesis project basically ready to go, and you should really have a specific faculty member in mind to work with.
592	Shuyao Zhou	3	This probably lies under book lists and recommendations which aren’t allowed outside the sticky’d weekly topics. r/booksuggestions, r/suggestmeabook, and r/whattoreadwhen is more welcoming to these sorts of threads.
593	Shuyao Zhou	2	This comes up a lot but it is a difficult thing to Google. Here's some previous discussion: [link]Basically it's a realism thing; it keeps up the conceit that the novel tells of real events, by implying there's been some anonymization.
594	Shuyao Zhou	2	I wish you luck on your reading journey!  My approach to the Horus Heresy has been piecemeal at best; I tend to just pick up whichever looks interesting, or whatever is included in the latest Humble Bundle.  I also have a notebook dedicated to keeping track of booklists like the one above!
595	Shuyao Zhou	2	I started my law course in semester 2 after transferring from Griffith University.First, the second semester of the 2022 academic year commences July 18, with semester one beginning, at least for me as a third year, on March 3, so you have plenty of time to sort out any administrative issues with QUT. Booklists: you'll get your booklist for your respective courses when you enrol and then register into your classes. So, until then, don't stress about booklists.ID card: this is fairly simple. If I recall correctly, I simply uploaded a photo to my profile in the student portal (I think it's formally called eStudent?) and requested a student ID card with that photograph on it. Do you have you QUT log in credentials to access HiQ, eStudent, and Blackboard? I've never actually had to use my ID card once outside of examinations (which for you will be from Novermber 5-19) and late access to the law library. Generally though, I would advise you contact HiQ on the numbers provided through this link: [https://www.qut.edu.au/about/contact](https://www.qut.edu.au/about/contact)Hope this helps :)
596	Shuyao Zhou	3	It looks like you're trying to start a conversation, but you haven't included much for users to respond to.

599	Shuyao Zhou	2	My great hope is that this obnoxious language shit will settle down as society becomes more open and stops terrorizing the queer community. I also think we’ll settle on more pleasant and natural expressions on over time. I’m very pleased with “they” as a gender neutral, way better than all the others.
600	Shuyao Zhou	2	Their friends are the bookclub.
601	Shuyao Zhou	3	I'm trying to connect up the various parts of your wide-ranging concerns. I recognise your outline of the various "schools", but I'm wondering how "human value" and its redefinition fits into that. Are you asking whether accessibility and utility have become a) "human values" (in a humanist sense?), b) "human *and thereby* literary values", c) "human *and thereby* aesthetic values" (differs from the previous in that what critics value in literature is not necessarily the aesthetic, however defined), d) some other combination of these/other concepts?In any case, I think the concepts of accessibility and utility for someone like Jameson must always be historicised: accessible and useful *for whom, at what time, in what kind of society*, etc. To my ear, accessibility has the ring of a kind of democratisation as an ideal with liberal overtones, and almost opposed to the modernist project. I would indeed be interested to see how you might connect the accessibility of literature to an emancipatory politics. I am reminded (as I often am!) of Jameson's article, "Reification and utopia in mass culture", which posits that popular media (his references are *Jaws* and the *Godfather* movies) are popular because they contain an emancipatory core, however transformed or even perverted it may have become. Perhaps what you can ask is how the emancipatory core can/needs to be transformed precisely because it needs to become accessible?
602	Shuyao Zhou	2	I say "podcasts", but I'm mostly listening to Great Courses lectures with regards to analysis of the source material and pop-culture podcasts with regards to the film. See [other comment][link]
603	Shuyao Zhou	1	i do a lot of reading related stuff, mostly /r/Fantasy r/books (the weekly threads only) /r/52book /r/suggestmeabook and /r/YAlit  /r/kpop lol /r/HobbyDrama and /r/iamveryculinary
604	Shuyao Zhou	1	Well God bless Oprah. I hope she has a long and fulfilling life. She surely made the world great with her booklists and interviews. God bless her
605	Shuyao Zhou	1	Great! Thanks for clarifying! It's getting a bit late, so I won't go into too much detail. If anything thus ends up reading too jargon-y, feel free to follow up!Depending on your focus, you will probably end up with the skills of a data scientist and digital consultant on the one hand - or those of an ethics consultant or policy adviser on the other. (Ideally both!)
606	Shuyao Zhou	3	Internet Invention is a book by Gregory Ulmer. The book describes Ulmer's definition of "electracy" (as opposed to orality or literacy) and leads readers through activities that ask them to examine their interactions with four discourses, which Ulmer labels career, family, entertainment, and community.

610	Shuyao Zhou	2	 I look at:1) The daily deals section. Found some great books there.2) See what people are reading on /r/52book3) Check genre subreddits like /r/fantasy4) Look at /r/suggestmeabook5) Go to a physical book store and see what's interesting. Then buy on Kobo.
611	Shuyao Zhou	1	I'm reading **The Master and Margarita** and **Hamnet** with r/bookclub. It's taken a lot of strength to not just finish Hamnet in one sitting. It is so enjoyable. I'm also trying to wrap up **A Series of Unfortunate Events: The End** this week in honor of my daughter's birthday (I read the first 10 to her in my belly). Also reading **Cleopatra's Dagger**. I finished **The Cruel Prince** this week, trying to dip my toes into fantasy. So far so good. 
612	Shuyao Zhou	2	If you turn off subreddit style (with RES) then it's almost usable, but there's still spam in there.
613	Shuyao Zhou	1	Flaired scholars, panelists, and directed discussions could very much be hosted here and I think would be beneficial.they could... or they could be hosted on /r/AskLiteraryStudies, as they have been for many years.
614	Shuyao Zhou	3	In formal Standard English, it would be "Joe's and my," as in, "Joe's (booklist) and my booklist." This is what you would be expected to use in formal writing and on grammar tests.In informal contexts, native speakers use all sorts of other combinations, e.g., "Joe and I's," "me and Joe's," etc.Also note that if you replace the pronoun "my" with another name or noun, then the format depends on whether the booklist is shared or each person has a separate booklist:"Joe and Jill's booklist" - The booklist is shared (i.e., there's only one), so possession is marked on the second noun only."Joe's and his brother's booklists" - Each person has a separate booklist (or more than one each), so possession is marked on both nouns.But the following is also possible:"Joe and Jill's booklists" - There are multiple booklists, but they all belong to both Joe and Jill.
615	Shuyao Zhou	2	**Gil's All Fright Diner by A. Lee Martinez:** A funny, laidback supernatural/paranormal read placed in Tennessee, perfect for October.**Tales from the Gas Station, Vol. 1 by Jack Townsend:** A great combination of humor, paranormal and horror, this was greatly enjoyable. Mr Creepypasta was an excellent choice for narrating it.**We Are Never Meeting in Real Life. by Samantha Irby:** It was interesting, at times sad and at times funny, the narration by the author seemed long-winded, not my favourite.**This is Going to Hurt, Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor by Adam Kay:** NHS cases recounted in wry, british humour (and why most healthcare systems have been collapsing the last few  years completely unprepared for a crisis)
616	Shuyao Zhou	3	Your submission has been removed for the following reason(s):ELI5 is not for:Subjective or speculative replies - Only objective explanations are permitted here; your question is asking for speculation or subjective responses This would be better placed in a book subreddit like /r/AskLiteraryStudies or /r/BookDiscussion
617	Shuyao Zhou	2	Submit to /r/WhatToReadWhen , I'm sure the guys on there would appreciate it. What's your stack?
618	Shuyao Zhou	2	I mean, r/books is probably the biggest and well known. r/bookdiscussion is also out there, but it's not very big.
619	Shuyao Zhou	2	Have you read the rest of Moore's books? Because they're amazing. I'd say Lamb and Fool(and it's about to be released serpent of venice) are the most similar since they are set in the past.
620	Shuyao Zhou	3	Popular enough to be known among those who like to read. Pick any mainstream "top 100 novels" list -- e.g. [Time's Top 100 Novels of 1923-2005][link] or [Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century][link]. The vast majority of those books have been translated into Japanese.
621	Shuyao Zhou	2	I've asked reddit how you guys keep track of books [here][link]Processed the input and built a tool - a better, cleaner way (compared to something like goodreads) to keep track of your books and make recommendations to your friends / followers.Read This Twice is not new, it's been around for a bit. It's a platform where we organize \~2000 leaders' book recommendations, and now you can create your own public profile, your own public/private reading lists with notes/comments/reviews.I'd love to get some feedback from people in here if this is something you'd potentially use.

623	Shuyao Zhou	1	I actually just finished reading this one as part of my reading challenge this year [link] and I loved it! And yet I completely agree with you. The lesson/s in it are nothing new or overly enlightening by the time you are in your 30s if you have a modicum of self awareness
624	Shuyao Zhou	3	A snowclone is a cliché and phrasal template that can be used and recognized in multiple variants. The term was coined as a neologism in 2004, derived from journalistic clichés that referred to the number of Eskimo words for snow.
625	Shuyao Zhou	1	Hello! Happy to see you are keeping these bookclub posts going - I didn't see the last one, but I just finished a book with some unexpected ace rep so came looking to see if there were any more posts where I could share my find!
626	Shuyao Zhou	1	Probably gonna be sent over to r/booksuggestions, r/suggestmeabook, or r/whattoreadwhen. Recommendations are only allowed in the weekly thread here.
627	Shuyao Zhou	3	I chose this as one of the 2022 popsugar reading challenge books as recommended by another /r/52book member suggested and I have mixed feelings. The world and voices were rich but I wanted more? I think I’m not so fond of strange chronology (as this book works backwards in time) because every small vignette of the Garcia girls’ lives I ended up wanting to see where it went from there, instead of stepping into the past further. But the writing itself was vibrant and full of life.
628	Shuyao Zhou	3	I'm sure you can find another subreddit to meet your needs if you don't like /r/books anymore. There are tons of book related subs and you could make your own [multireddit][link]  that gives you what you want.* /r/52book* /r/audiobooks[link]
629	Shuyao Zhou	2	I know of r/AskLiteraryStudies. Not sure if that's exactly what you want.
630	Shuyao Zhou	1	More so me than my friends, and I feel bad about it sometimes. But when the weekend *finally* rolls around, I'm tired and I want to spend time with my family. I'd rather have friends over to play board games in person or watch a movie. If I game these days, it's solo. Multiplayer games just come with too much required effort and game-knowledge unless you want to be a detriment to your friends. I still have my PC and consoles. I still get excited about upcoming releases (though rarely actually play them anymore), but when it comes down to staying up late on a Friday/Saturday to play games together until the wee hours...it's just not super appealing to me anymore. And that kinda sucks, because I have some friendships that exist entirely online, primarily around gaming together, and I don't want those to be lost.
631	Shuyao Zhou	2	Right now I’m just being downvoted despite this being r/AskLiteraryStudies and not r/AskEnglishLiterature. I should’ve expected that. Even though I realize now that I forgot to say what it was actually from, though to be fair, anyone who would know the answer would also know where it was from and probably not downvote me.
632	Shuyao Zhou	2	I've also noticed that there's a moderate percentage of people who post here who don't seem very savvy with reddit/formatting/etc. - they might not be regular redditors, but they're in search of a book. I think adding extra rules would discourage some of these people from posting, which would be a shame.
633	Shuyao Zhou	3	For teen girls, there's r/feemagers which may be exactly what you're looking for.As far as books go:* r/bookdiscussion* r/suggestmeabook* r/truebooks* r/currentlyreading
634	Shuyao Zhou	3	I agree, but I do have some thoughts on this plot hole (sorry in advance for the wall of text). I think that the Order's members magic (Tonks casting "Locomotor Trunk", etc) at the Dursley's House did actually register with the Trace and the Ministry did send additional owls telling Harry he had committed further crimes. However, by the time the Ministry would have sent these owl, Harry would have left Privet Drive well before they arrived. I mean, it did take some time for the ones the Ministry sent for the Patronus charm to show up at the Dursleys house (the owls only started arriving well after Harry had carried Dudley home with Mrs. Figg, and then got into a heated argument with the Uncle Vernon). Why then did Harry not receive these letters from the owls? Well shortly after he left the Dursleys, he arrived at Number 12 Grimmauld Place. While I'm not exactly sure how a secret keeper would affect how efficiently an owl can deliver a letter to the intended receiver, I don't think the letters would have gotten to Harry. After his trial while Harry is waiting for his fifth year letter to arrive listing what textbooks he would need for the upcoming year, the letter isn't delivered to him directly. It's Ron who brings it to him: [quote]The lateness of the letters arrival may simply be because Harry, Ron and Hermione were at a location with a secret keeper and they could not be delivered properly. Regardless, if the ministry had sent letters to Harry for magic the Order members did while collecting him from the Dursleys, I do not think these letters would have reached him. They would have not been delivered, or would have gone to Dumbledore (the secret keeper) or some other Order member living there at the time.So if the ministry did actually send letters to Harry about this magic, the next question would be why didn't the ministry bring it up at his trial? I'd suspect Dumbledore would have been able to clear it up easily. When Harry first cast the patronus charm, he was told in one of the letters he received from Mr. Weasley that Dumbledore was at the ministry talking to Fudge and dealing with the situation. Eventually Dumbledore was able to get his expulsion suspended until Harry went to his Hearing. So this shows that Dumbledore was actively involved in this case. So while Harry was waiting for his trial at Grimmauld place, I think Dumbledore could have easily presented evidence to the ministry via priori incantatem to show that Tonks or whoever had casted magic when collecting Harry, getting those charges dropped.I agree with OP this is a plot hole, but I think the Ministry did detect Tonks and others magic at the Dursley's house. They likely sent a letter to Harry with additional charges but he never received it (he was at Grimmauld Place) and Dumbledore cleared the situation up before it could be brought up at Harry's trial.
635	Shuyao Zhou	3	John Perkins started and stopped writing Confessions of an Economic Hit Man four times over 20 years. He says he was threatened and bribed in an effort to kill the project, but after 9/11 he finally decided to go through with this expose of his former professional life. Perkins, a former chief economist at Boston strategic-consulting firm Chas. T. Main, says he was an "economic hit man" for 10 years, helping U.S. intelligence agencies and multinationals cajole and blackmail foreign leaders into serving U.S. foreign policy and awarding lucrative contracts to American business. "Economic hit men (EHMs) are highly paid professionals who cheat countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars," Perkins writes. Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is an extraordinary and gripping tale of intrigue and dark machinations. Think John Le Carré, except it's a true story.

637	Shuyao Zhou	3	**[Mongolian death worm] [link]The Mongolian death worm (Mongolian: олгой-хорхой, olgoi-khorkhoi, "large intestine worm") is a creature alleged to exist in the Gobi Desert. The creature first came to Western attention as a result of Roy Chapman Andrews's 1926 book On the Trail of Ancient Man. The American paleontologist described second-hand tales of the monster that he heard at a gathering of Mongolian officials: "None of those present ever had seen the creature, but they all firmly believed in its existence and described it minutely".
638	Shuyao Zhou	3	[outside link] Caitlín R. Kiernan is one of dark fantasy and horror’s most acclaimed and influential short fiction writers. Her powerful, unexpected stories shatter morality, gender, and sexuality: a reporter is goaded by her toxic girlfriend into visiting sadistic art exhibits; a countess in a decaying movie theater is sated by her servants; a collector offers his greatest achievement to ensnare a musician who grieves for her missing sister. In this retrospective collection of her finest work—previously only available in limited editions—Kiernan cuts straight to the heart of the emotional truths we cannot ignore.
639	Shuyao Zhou	2	Forget not that it is a city like all others. If you want to experience real interesting things, start an activity that will connect you to people in zurich. One of the greatest things is dancing: check out salsa and bachata if you want to experience greatest moments. Else i suggest sports like volleyball or cultural activities like sailing or bookdiscussion groups. Whatever stick to an activity, without it, wherever you go it seems boring and empty. With it great and all starts deveoping on its own

641	Shuyao Zhou	2	I remember when he was on the Raiders, he had a bookclub or blog about his read list
642	Shuyao Zhou	2	For strictly ELA, the kids like having sheets so I pull from Evan Moor (through teacher file box) and the Moffatt Girls (TPT). Then I just read from the books that interest us from the booklists of B+R and torchlight.
643	Shuyao Zhou	1	Possibly a sub like [r/AskLiteraryStudies][link]? It seems like r/books may be able to help? But literary studies does have a post near the top that makes it seem like they get a lot of questions they don't like answering so who knows...
644	Shuyao Zhou	1	his sub is kinda garbage IMO. Its turned into pop culture Oprah bookclub wishing for fairy magic stuff. You need to realize that everything is energy, so you need to find ways to get your internal world in tune with the reality you want. meditation and Neville Goddard as already suggested. The most important thing is you need to work with your subconscious to accept your affirmations or whatever.
645	Shuyao Zhou	3	[link] Lüshi (traditional Chinese: 律詩; simplified Chinese: 律诗; pinyin: lǜshī; Wade–Giles: lü-shih) refers to a specific form of Classical Chinese poetry verse form. One of the most important poetry forms of classical Chinese poetry, the lüshi refers to an eight-line regulated verse form with lines made up of five, six, or seven characters; thus:  Five-character eight-line regulated verse (wulü): a form of regulated verse with eight lines of five characters each. Six-character eight-line regulated verse is relatively rare. Seven-character eight-line regulated verse (qilü): a form of regulated verse with eight lines of seven characters each. 
646	Shuyao Zhou	2	/r/ScottMeyer was the best I could find. For a lot of, lets say not super popular authors, there's not going to be much better sadly, you'd be better off discussing it in /r/books, /r/bookdiscussion, /r/fantasy, and so on.
647	Shuyao Zhou	3	The incredible true story of the women who fought America's Undark dangerThe Curies' newly discovered element of radium makes gleaming headlines across the nation as the fresh face of beauty, and wonder drug of the medical community. From body lotion to tonic water, the popular new element shines bright in the otherwise dark years of the First World War.Meanwhile, hundreds of girls toil amidst the glowing dust of the radium-dial factories. The glittering chemical covers their bodies from head to toe; they light up the night like industrious fireflies. With such a coveted job, these "shining girls" are the luckiest alive—until they begin to fall mysteriously ill.But the factories that once offered golden opportunities are now ignoring all claims of the gruesome side effects, and the women's cries of corruption. And as the fatal poison of the radium takes hold, the brave shining girls find themselves embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of America's early 20th century, and in a groundbreaking battle for workers' rights that will echo for centuries to come.Written with a sparkling voice and breakneck pace, The Radium Girls fully illuminates the inspiring young women exposed to the "wonder" substance of radium, and their awe-inspiring strength in the face of almost impossible circumstances. Their courage and tenacity led to life-changing regulations, research into nuclear bombing, and ultimately saved hundreds of thousands of lives.
648	Shuyao Zhou	1	popheads takeover of /r/52book in action let's go
649	Shuyao Zhou	2	I found [this list] [link] on SocialJustice.org and there's a short list of books covering American slavery at the bottom of [this page][link]for middle readers. For the Chinese Exclusion Act, I found two books specifically mentioned [here][link]. Sadly, I haven't read *any* of the middle-level books listed on any of these pages, so I cannot make specific recommendations.
650	Shuyao Zhou	2	This was another The Alchemist for me. Everyone in my bookclub loved it and found it deeply insightful. I really wanted to like it but I just found it cliché. I agree with others that the protagonist wasn't relatable... things just kept happening to her. It was a frustrating read.
651	Shuyao Zhou	2	If I have a specific question about a particular book I am referencing, AskLiteraryStudies (or any classics-related forum) can be useful. I find that the more I work, the more my questions are about other books anyway.
652	Shuyao Zhou	1	I second this. My bookclub just finished this book this week and there's so many great lessons to learn in here.
653	Shuyao Zhou	3	[link]Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and soul-stirring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago, who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried near the Pyramids. 
654	Shuyao Zhou	1	The book is ok, there are better works by him.
655	Shuyao Zhou	3	Thought in which sense? In terms of literature, he (along with Keats and some other English Romantic poets) certainly had a large impact, especially on the Transcendentalists. His influence on Hemingway is very clear. For the first half of his life, Coleridge was not only a firm abolitionist, but also openly advocated the idea of full equality of all races in all manners. This modern liberalism (in fact, Coleridge in the first half of his life can be classified as a radical in terms contemporary to his time) found in his lectures and poems definitely influenced American artists' thought in the late nineteenth century and it can be argued that this contributed to the increased demand for some form of racial equality among *fin de siècle* artistic circles in the US. It must be noted, however, that in the second half of his live, Coleridge grew increasingly conservative, began to justify racism and slavery, and even advocated a form of proto-social Darwinism based off of the Bible, something to which he had previously vehemently argued humans should not defer in the context of race. You will likely get a more comprehensive answer if you ask this question on r/askliterarystudies. I hope this helps! :D
656	Shuyao Zhou	2	The bookclub Sub is in the middle of one actually.  They are starting SoS next month.  It seems a lot of them plan on attempting to do the Cosmere after, so it might not be a bad idea to set up a Cosmere one, start with a Mistborn read along now to try and line up with the book club ending theirs with the release and presumable reading of TLM.    Then all the bookclubbers can hope on over for a continuation into the deeper Cosmere.
657	Shuyao Zhou	2	Mods may shortly remind you of rule 3
658	Shuyao Zhou	2	I've just settled with the idea that this sub is about booksI figured that out just from the name.not literature.Well, as literature is a subset of books in general, it doesn't make sense that this sub would be strictly about literature. As luck would have it, though, there is a sub entirely devoted to literature. It's called /r/literature. If you want a sub dedicated to book discussions (vs. anything generally about books), you might try /r/bookdiscussion. That seems to be a lightly populated sub right now, so it seems like a handful of users (say, for instance, the ones in threads like this complaining of a lack of book discussion) could go over there and make it into the kind of  sub they want /r/books to be. There is also, /r/bookclub, which is also dominated by book discussion. Though they are obviously primarily focused on the current books of the month, not exclusively so.
659	Shuyao Zhou	1	It was the most difficult book I've ever Read Run/ bookclub!!
660	Shuyao Zhou	1	While I don't want to slight this subreddit, I think you've got a lot more chance of getting a comprehensive answer to this on a sub like r/AskLiteraryStudies, r/classics, or perhaps r/AskHistorians.
661	Shuyao Zhou	2	There's No Bookclub Jeff award
662	Shuyao Zhou	2	It was a slower week for me. * I read **The Black Tides of Heaven, by Neon Yang**: I loved the worldbuilding behind this silkpunk novella, there’s simply a massive influx of creativity obvious here. That said, I had some issues with the pacing the characterizations, in all it just felt a bit rushed.* 85% complete and will soon finish **Dune Messiah, by Frank Herbert**. The climax is really compelling! I will absolutely be moving ahead with Children of Dune after this. * Done 6 out of 9 short stories in **Exhalation; Stories, by Ted Chiang.** This has been such a wonderful reading experience. Top stories so far are the Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate, Exhalation (the title story), and Truth of Fact, Truth of Feeling (which I read this morning and absolutely adored). * 25% complete **Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead**, **by Olga Tokarczuk.** I'm really enjoying it. Surprisingly laugh-out-loud funny at some points, and just such creative fiction here. 
663	Shuyao Zhou	2	 I'm thinking central Phoenix to North Tempe/South Scottsdale area. Open to other ideas though. 
664	Shuyao Zhou	1	Get a pet. Make some friends. Join a bookclub. Join a church. There are many ways not to be lonely. I love my kids, but they have their own lives, and one of them lives a couple of thousand miles from me. They don’t belong to me, and it’s not their job to make me happy
665	Shuyao Zhou	1	She is already a pretty big name in Malayam, and this novel has made her a pretty big name in translated fiction circles. Check it out if you are looking for any regional stuff.I want to read Indian stuff more man. I'm so oblivious to it that it's straight up shamefulI've got a book downloaded I still need to get to that. Ugh fuck my lazy arse.
666	Shuyao Zhou	2	I started listening to downtown for the Christmas music and it's ended up just being on in my car, and it's fucking cat. None of the presenters have any personality to speak of, there's even a show where they have two guys on and between them they don't have a personality. There's a woman with a monotone who sounds like she's either brainwashed or reading off a page.So not that.U105 is a bit better but if you're really listening to it it's awful. They play the same songs far too often and you'll never want to hear Oops Upside Your Head ever again. They have three newreaders who eternally sound like it's their first day on the job and they are sitting dying after being up all night taking coke. Carolyn Stewart's show is pretty good, Frank Mitchell's can be depending on what he's talking about but that's more down to the people who ring in.
667	Shuyao Zhou	2	There's also the [weekly recommendation thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2mgd3p/weekly_recommendation_thread_for_the_week_of/) and the various recommendation subs pulled from this [List of book related subs](http://www.reddit.com/r/BookRelatedSubs/wiki/sublist)
668	Shuyao Zhou	2	I think celebrity memoir Bookclub (the podcast) has done stassis. I haven’t heard that episode but they usually spill all the tea and have some good banter.
669	Shuyao Zhou	1	Our post Mormon bookclub read “Zealot” last year! It made so much more sense to me than anything I had heard at church. We also read “sapiens” and “who wrote the Bible” Right around the same time and that was pretty much it for me! Highly recommend this trio of books!
670	Shuyao Zhou	3	Your post is better suited to the [link] or /r/52book.
671	Shuyao Zhou	1	You mean r/bookdiscussion?
672	Shuyao Zhou	1	He asked me to get naked sa videocall after ng bookdiscussion
673	Shuyao Zhou	1	That’s really no different than this little millionaire booklet I saw being talked about on Instagram 5-7 years ago. It had the millionaire mindset to get to a millionaire status and people were including it all over their booklists. It was $7 dollars so I bought one out of curiosity. Pretty much just a TLDR of one or two rich dad poor dad quotes mixed in with a you just need to sell a $20 product 50,000 times, or a $200 product 5,000 times, etc. So your dad had a joke but people do it all the time lol
674	Shuyao Zhou	3	How to Be A Perfect Stranger (6th Edition): The Essential Religious Etiquette Handbook [link]Judaism specific:The Book of Jewish Values: A Day-by-Day Guide to Ethical Living [link]Rabbi Jill Jacobs and Rabbi Jonathan Sacks both have written a fair amount of justice/ethics/morality books also but I'm less familiar with those. More generally sometimes the easiest way to avoid saying the wrong thing or to come off as polite is to broaden your knowledge base and what perspectives you've explored. Something like these books might work: [link]
675	Shuyao Zhou	3	If you read my post you’d see that I had already started one of the books for a book club I joined, so I was definitely not looking for recommendations in that regard. I was looking for comments that would inspire good discussion, like the first comment saying that I should definitely read Ready Player One prior to watching the movie.  
676	Shuyao Zhou	2	Just found r/52book which seems like a more chill bookclub. Probably a good spot to search for bookbuddies as well.
677	Shuyao Zhou	2	As a kid I was constantly reading. I zapped right through 500 page Harry Potter books. As a teen I hardly read any books. I also didn't read a lot of the litterature I had to read for school. I just memorized a summary I found online. Yes, I know, I'm trash, but I honestly got better grades when I didn't read the book, because in tests and book reports I focussed less on unimportant details. As an adult I really wanted to read more, because I do like it, but I often started books, but didn't finish them, because I lost interest. What helped me read more as an adult was start a bookclub so I had to read at least one book a month. Also, weirdly Goodreads helped me read more, because you can update your progress and see an overview of the books you've read in a year. That just gives a little serotonine boost whenever I update my progress or finish a book. Last year I read 34 books.
678	Shuyao Zhou	1	In the book I'm looking for, the boy and his parents are kind of the only vampires where they live besides the enemy vampires from what I can remember! I've looked through many of the vampire book lists on Goodreads and couldn't find it so I'm assuming it's not very well known which makes it so much harder to find.
679	Shuyao Zhou	3	Please post lists of books in /r/booklists.
680	Shuyao Zhou	3	This is a sub for pictures of people's bookshelves. /r/books, /r/bookdiscussion, /r/paranormalromance, and /r/YALit would be better places for this.
681	Shuyao Zhou	1	Oh, my bad.In this case, my number one advice—trite as it may be—is to *write much* and to *read even more*. 
682	Shuyao Zhou	1	I got you fam.Here you go /u/syphilis_pretzel. The link, is on the sidebar.[link]
683	Shuyao Zhou	2	Yes, I did. It was phenomenal. [Here][link]  are my thoughts.
684	Shuyao Zhou	2	I was taking with someone about making a queer/butch bookclub discord
685	Shuyao Zhou	1	Let me know if you're interested and send me a message! Have a great day :)
686	Shuyao Zhou	1	You should check out /r/52book, it’s a challenge to read at least 1 book a week for a year.Lol, I have zero aspiration to do anything close to this with my free time.
687	Shuyao Zhou	3	If you are unclear about the removal reason you should ask in reply to the mod comment in your original post, or send a question to modmail.Here is the relevant section of rules regarding book lists, with the specific part bolded. No low quality book lists. To maintain quality, the list must encourage discussion. For linked lists the list itself must have descriptive paragraphs for each book. Users are also encouraged to submit their own unique lists as a self/text-post. **Original lists should have at least a paragraph explaining the reason for the list and include some further thoughts on at least a few of the books.** The poster must have actually read each book. Alternatively, there is /r/booklists.If you are still unclear about why your post was removed please reply here or use modmail.
688	Shuyao Zhou	3	I'm a witch who's been practicing since the 1980s, and I'm a big book nerd too.  I've been putting together lists of some of the better books on various witchy topics such as working with herbs, trance work, spirits, and have the lists available at my website here: [link]You should probably also check out some of the other witch-related subreddits as they often have lists of recommended books in their FAQs and wikis, and the participants are pretty good about suggesting books if you ask for specific topics.  Check out r/witchcraft, r/WitchesVsPatriarchy, r/SASSWitches, r/paganism, r/FriendlyPagans, r/witchcraftbookclub,   r/realwitchcraft and r/AskWitches in particular.
689	Shuyao Zhou	1	I read a lot!  You should join r/52book!  You don’t have to have a goal of 52 any goal is fine and it’s a nice chill welcoming book sub.
690	Shuyao Zhou	1	lets make one...would be like a bookclub...every week we get a new cock to suck and chat about it...every week? is that too infrequent hehe
691	Shuyao Zhou	1	Man this sub really needs a rule about not posting homework help, /r/askliterarystudies already has one.

694	Shuyao Zhou	3	Klara and the Sun is the eighth novel by the Nobel Prize-winning British writer Kazuo Ishiguro, published on 2 March 2021. It is a dystopian science fiction story. Set in the U.S. in an unspecified future, the book is told from the point of view of Klara, a solar-powered AF (Artificial Friend), who is chosen by Josie, a sickly child, to be her companion. The novel was longlisted for the 2021 Booker Prize.
695	Shuyao Zhou	1	Sidebar....
696	Shuyao Zhou	2	I meant she needs to do something like a bookclub and not rely on you for her social needs. She should not be attempting to make her happiness your responsibility.
697	Shuyao Zhou	1	I also told him that I think it would be a good idea for him to talk to a counselor or therapist at least once to get some advice on how to deal with someone who is so emotionally abusive and cruel. And besides, I just can't keep hearing about how awful she is every other day. It's too distressing and triggering for me.
698	Shuyao Zhou	2	You probably haven't experienced discrimination based on anti-paganism or anti-atheism. Think it was the 90s or 00s that being non-conforming to religion actually became somewhat accepted without social or economic repercussion, in most places.
699	Shuyao Zhou	1	go ahead she needs more friends for her bookclub i think
700	Shuyao Zhou	2	Is there a box immediately above your post here saying “Check out r/AskLiteraryStudies”?
701	Shuyao Zhou	3	You'll be better served at /r/askliterarystudies
702	Shuyao Zhou	2	In seattle, there’s Ye Olde Curiosity Shoppe and a great horror movie section at MoPop.
703	Shuyao Zhou	1	I know this may sound goofy but I’ve been trying to train myself to put down the phone and pick up the kindle or a paper book whenever I see a picture of a book/read list/post in /r/books or /r/52book (I just got curious about this post and clicked in)
704	Shuyao Zhou	1	I love the discussion post style bookclub. I'm new to Reddit and came from a discord/video call bookclub so this is totally different! You're not put on the spot, you can pick and choose what you respond to, word vomit a little without interrupting anyone. I certainly didn't appreciate it enough in school lol.
705	Shuyao Zhou	1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit
706	Shuyao Zhou	3	Check out the r/broomclosetwitch wiki, they have links to occult PDF libraries might be helpful. Also try r/heathery, they've posted a few links to booklists if I remember correctly.
707	Shuyao Zhou	1	Oh my fucking god 😂😂
708	Shuyao Zhou	1	I legit think you/your husband would be surprised how many "literary" readers also read similar level books - everyone I know that reads a lot (and in the more "highbrow" reas like classics or whatever) also read percy jackson, artemis fowl etc. 
709	Shuyao Zhou	2	Are all the parents going to work and add value to society, or will some just join a bookclub.
710	Shuyao Zhou	1	u/migmatite_rock You're two examples are blatantly political and don't represent much of what constitutes literary theory although they may represent what is often on reddit.My colleague did not direct to r/AskLiteraryStudies, and I would send you there.This is something entirely different than the things that Eagleton gets published in journals about writers like Dickens (an which i admittedly have not read).If you have a specific item you're reading, send me a message in chat and I will not hesitate to help you if I can.  However, if your question is on the specific nature of literary criticism, I'm going to warn you that you will be met with hostility, and that the best place to ask for assistance is probably r/AskLiteraryStudies.  It's not the duty of people on reddit in a book forum to defend the practice of literary criticism.  No one here owes you any time.  As I said, I will happily, in my own time, do what I can, but concern trolling is trolling and there are forums where asking difficult questions about literary theory are really the main point of the forum ( r/AskLiteraryStudies).

712	Shuyao Zhou	1	There was a story that Searle told at one point about Foucault, where Searle asked Foucault You're so clear when speaking to me, so why the hell do you write so badly?  And Foucault said In France, if you don't have at least 10% incomprehensibility, people don't think you're very profound.  (I don't have the direct quote but it was basically that).
713	Shuyao Zhou	1	also /r/bookdiscussion exists as well
714	Shuyao Zhou	2	[link]You can do it through a book or a movie first before talking about a child. Like find a book or a movie with an autistic character and watch it a few times together
715	Shuyao Zhou	1	/r/books hot threads are truly the bottom of the barrel for book related shit lmao. i still like the what are you reading threads and sometimes if you can catch something that doesnt get more than 50 comments it's ok.  seconding /r/52book as a good alternative! it's very fun and positive and generally less... weird about specific books/genres/audiences. i also have been having a pretty good time in /r/Fantasy (tho big threads can still get weird) and also there are too many authors i like with active accounts! i don't want to be perceived by authors ever thank you. agree on /r/YAlit having good vibes too tho i'm not really a ya reader anymore.i also hang out in /r/HobbyDrama and /r/iamveryculinary and stop by like... /r/houseplants every so often
716	Shuyao Zhou	3	I'll list a some books in a few different categories that I think might fit what you're suggesting. None of these are very unique or obscure, as a lot of these are from advanced language arts classes I had in high school and college. They did give a good general base of knowledge and were all interesting reads at worst, and formative at best. That's also not to say I liked all of them - but I'll put my thoughts later. Some of these are in my personal library as well. **Nonfiction*** Philosophy/Politics   * *Apology* and *Phaedo* by Plato; both chronicle events towards the end of Socrates' life, and as far as philosophy can be funny, the *Apology* is    * *The Prince* by Machiavelli; I won't lie, I despise the principles in this book, but it explains (to me) a lot of why the world is the way that it is    * As far as Christian philosophy goes, I would recommend anything by C.S. Lewis (yes, the guy that wrote Narnia), especially *Mere Christianity* if you're looking into apologetics. I've also heard good things about *The Screwtape Letters* if you want something a bit more readable, though I haven't read that one personally. Dante's *Divine Comedy* is another option, if a bit tedious to get through. * Other   * *Into Thin Air* by Jon Krakauer; I cannot recommend this book enough. I've also read *Into the Wild* but I didn't find it quite as compelling as this one   * *In Cold Blood* by Truman Capote; a good read if you're at all interested in crime stories (side note: there is a fascinating conspiracy that Capote is actually the author of *To Kill a Mockingbird*)   * *On Writing* by Stephen King for some reason; not sure why this one stuck with me but it sure did    * *The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat* by Oliver Sacks; saw it mentioned elsewhere in this thread too. Good book, humorous for what content it contains**Fiction*** Race relations/Black history   * *The Help* by Kathryn Stockett; fantastic movie and even better book   * *Beloved* by Toni Morrison; frankly any book by her is worth a read * Sociology?    * *Let the Great World Spin* by Colum McCann; probably up there with the best books I've ever read and probably #1 on this whole list   * *The Scarlet Letter* by Nathaniel Hawthorne   * *The Poisonwood Bible* by Barbara Kingsolver* Psychology    * *Room* by Emma Donoghue; gripping and chilling and in general an amazing read* Shakespeare   * I really liked *Othello* and *The Merchant of Venice*. *Hamlet* is a good read because you'll find similar plot structures in a lot of famous things (it gets contrasted with the Lion King a lot)So that's a brief list of reads that I found most memorable/helpful/worldview-refining. 
717	Shuyao Zhou	1	A good time to do it! Semi-related: a bookclub friend read all the *Dune* stuff -- meaning the ones by Frank Herbert (6) and the ones by his son, Brian, which was something insane like 25. More or less back-to-back (he had to slot in the club reads of course). I don't know how he did on it. I couldn't keep my reading that focused. I need some variety.
718	Shuyao Zhou	1	Not everyone in 52book does 52 - it’s absolutely ‘pick your own number’. Last year I aimed for 50 so I could give myself a couple of weeks leeway
719	Shuyao Zhou	2	Yes, it happens in /r/AskLiteraryStudies a fair amount. [quote].
720	Shuyao Zhou	2	There is a [bookdiscussion][link] subreddit that looks like it never got off of the ground, but it could if enough of us participated in it.  I love reading /literature and /printsf, but they certainly don't cover most of what I actually read.
721	Shuyao Zhou	1	We are here . . . r/52book
722	Shuyao Zhou	2	maybe /r/whattolistenwhen could help? if it's still active, it's a sister sub to /r/whattoreadwhen
723	Shuyao Zhou	2	Well known classics. I'm trying to go through the interesting books on the PBS Great American Read list. An excellent place to find a book if I'm stuck on what to read next.
724	Shuyao Zhou	1	Try out This Is How You Lose The Time War.
725	Shuyao Zhou	1	This. I joined r/52book last year, and on the whole it was really great. But the completionist in me started pushing through books I didn't really want to, just to get "credit", and I was also flying through books when I didn't feel like reading.I don't want it to be like that. Trying to find my personal middle ground between goal setting and burning out.
726	Shuyao Zhou	3	You should post it on /r/suggestmeabook or /r/whattoreadwhen. These subs are more suitable for recommendations.
727	Shuyao Zhou	2	Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure. Now I'll take my bookish snobbery somewhere else. Perhaps /r/literature or /r/newbooks or maybe even /r/bookdiscussion
728	Shuyao Zhou	1	just recently this children's book was released showing gay porn to kids. a fucking children's reading bookclub was inviting this weird costumed man with a cock.

734	Shuyao Zhou	2	How much energy does it cost to ignore people? If you don't want to hear about the movie, then listen to something else, like music.And it IS unreasonable to expect him to not even talk about the movie/his interests with his friends (especially when you only asked him to not talk about it with you).
735	Shuyao Zhou	3	You’re most likely going to be sent to r/suggestmeabook, r/booksuggestions, or r/whattoreadwhen. They have serious bibliographers who can help you out.
736	Shuyao Zhou	2	/r/bookdiscussion ? It seems mostly abandoned, but the mods are still active in other subs, so if they're not interested in moderating, perhaps they could add someone from here who wants to do it.
737	Shuyao Zhou	3	look up Charlotte Mason booklists for you child's age.
738	Shuyao Zhou	1	Okay mod hat off.So none of these were what you were looking for? You can request abandoned subs in /r/redditrequest so you can start with existing subscribers rather than adding book sub number 755:* /r/truebooks* /r/currentlyreading* /r/Casual_Books* /r/CasualBooks* /r/BooksUncensored* /r/Bookies* /r/bookdiscussion
739	Shuyao Zhou	2	r/RomanceBooks is a good place to go for romance suggestionsI'd also suggest r/52book it's ostensibly for folks trying to read a book a week but I find a bunch of great books from what other folks are reading. Some great (fantasy) romance/YA I've read in the last couple of years:A Court of Thorns and Roses    Scythe    The Cruel Prince    Scholomance    Song of AchillesHouse in the Cerulean SeaGideon the NinthReady Player One (if you're into games)    Rick Riordan's books if you haven't already read
740	Shuyao Zhou	1	Gotta respect it regardless, my way of kings hardback is ‘bookclub edition’ so it’s an inch shorter than all the others on my shelf 🙈
741	Shuyao Zhou	3	A few scattered thoughts and suggestions:- Journals: If you believe your work is good enough, just submit to your favourite journals in your field. Chances are the journals you enjoy reading would also like the kind of things you write. Go for a more specialised journal if the big ones seem intimidating. You should put a bit of thought into it, though, since you can only submit an article to one at a time.- University departments: AFAIK, American universities will be fine with a much vague PhD project than European ones, where you'll be expected to go in and start working right away, while there's usually a year or two of coursework (like a second MA) in the US. Other people will have more precise recommendations, I hope.- If you have any literary interests at all, check out comparative literature departments in the US, as well as English and modern language departments. This last might be a bit of an awkward fit for you as your interests are in German but that's not one of your languages.- /r/AskLiteraryStudies is good if you do look at lit departments. There's also /r/ComparativeLiterature, but it's quite small. /r/GradSchool might be good too, but I don't know that sub at all.
742	Shuyao Zhou	1	Try /r/TrueBooks or /r/CurrentlyReading other /r/bookdiscussion subs seem to be inactive. 
743	Shuyao Zhou	1	I'll be honest I get most of my updates on happenings in the US from The Daily Show and The LAte Show. &amp;#x200B;Sad sign when I trust comedians to get it right than actual newreaders
744	Shuyao Zhou	1	2021 was the year I tried audiobooks for the first time. But I just needed to have the physical copies too. It's a bad habit I'm trying to overcome. I have had some REALLY good reads this year. I rated them in tiers (I regret putting "Shout" in good and not great) I hope this answers your question. [Books rated in tiers][link]
745	Shuyao Zhou	2	Might be worth asking this on r/AskLiteraryStudies if you have not done so yet
746	Shuyao Zhou	1	I'll have to try Story Graph.Zlib has two separate features for keep track of books, Favorites and Booklists. They're both great and really well coded. I much prefer the layout of the booklists to the favorites and I'm trying to migrate all my favorites over there, but you have to do it one book at a time and I have 35 pages of them :(
747	Shuyao Zhou	2	r/bookclub are doing a read along of this right now also if you’re interested.
748	Shuyao Zhou	2	Chaiery was told by booksmarts that some people might not think she is black enough to say the word nigga casually. He said she should probably stop. They apparently had an argument at the time and reached no satifactory conclusion, later on stream Chaiery talked about the interaction and how she thought that booksmart was just too scared to say that he thought she wasn't black enough to say nigga and was hiding behind an imaginary group of people who wouldn't think she was black enough. Memes ensued but I'm not part of the bookclub so I don't know if he's actually getting cancelled or if people are just clowning him on twitter.
749	Shuyao Zhou	2	I will be messaging you in 14 days.
750	Shuyao Zhou	1	Yep. Looks like your post violates this rule of that subreddit: [link]
751	Shuyao Zhou	3	You should ask this on r/askliterarystudies, since it's been removed here.
752	Shuyao Zhou	2	If you haven't done so yet, come and join everyone in r/52book. The challenge is to read 1 book a week for a year but really it's just about setting out your own goals. Whether it's 5 or 100.
753	Shuyao Zhou	2	I’m new to the 52book challenge and I’d love to make some friends. I like fantasy, sci-fi, and fiction. Currently finishing up Dune. I’d love some recommendations and discussions! [Goodreads][link]
754	Shuyao Zhou	1	 Forever Never is dual POV :) You can probably find a lot of recs that are by using the search function. You might run into some rants from folks who don't like it (I do) but people mention it or ask the question often enough that you should be able to find some good recs! I remember seeing The Bromance Bookclub getting shout outs as a fun one for men to read but I haven't read it yet myself. 
755	Shuyao Zhou	2	Our kids prefer to own most of their books so they can share and re-read. Libraries have book sales. Try booksalefinder.com. The Mensa website has good booklists broken down by age group. You can also google top 100 kids chapter books of all time and start there.
756	Shuyao Zhou	2	/r/linguistics or /r/askhistorians or /r/askliterarystudies would be better places to find this info.
757	Shuyao Zhou	2	I think it has a good story, the lack of difficulty or progression ruins it for me though. I really don’t need the uniquely named overland drop and there are better ways of gaining experience. I guess my issue is, I want to play the game not watch a movie.
758	Shuyao Zhou	2	I don't think there's a good catch-all term here... though you could check with r/askliterarystudies as it's possible there's something more defined in that world that could be applied here.I've seen people use "Thematic Shift" to discuss the technique you seem to be describing. Though, I think that term applies pretty well to *Hereditary* and less so to something like *Mulholland Drive.*
759	Shuyao Zhou	1	When I was 6/7 yo this album scared the shit out of me.  I wasn't old enough to appreciate that voices coming though the speakers speaking like newsreaders *weren't actually newreaders*.
760	Shuyao Zhou	1	New from Robert Garofalo, an instructional unit on Milhaud's original classic work for band, Suite Francaise. This incredible teaching tool contains Interpretive Analysis, Folk Song Sources, Teacher's Lesson Plan and Student Learning Guide. Written for any band or orchestra conductor planning to perform this work. An outstanding teaching tool that applies the MENC "Standards" to the podium. A "MUST HAVE" for the serious wind band conductor!
761	Shuyao Zhou	1	Thank you for posting this! I have been very dismayed to see some of the attitudes from FFA bubbling over into my real life. I’m in the US and in a bookclub of 8 women in their 30s. Pretty much every meeting there’s a conversation about being too old for fashion. People talk about buying cheap leggings from Costco because they don’t want to spend money on clothes and how nothing fits their decrepit 35-year-old body. The Costco leggings are my real life version of the greige sack. Ugh! I hate this attitude! Of course, not everyone is into fashion and has money to spend on it, but I feel the prevailing attitude is that if you are over 30 and not a size 2, fashion is not for you and you are frivolous for thinking about it.
762	Shuyao Zhou	1	There's a lot of subreddits for different genres! (though they have varying levels of activity). Here are a few: /r/fantasy /r/romancenovels /r/YAlit /r/DystopianBooks /r/HorrorLit /r/paranormalromance /r/urbanfantasy /r/GraphicNovelsThere's also some other subreddits that are geared towards discussing books (again, varying levels of activity):/r/BookDiscussion /r/CurrentlyReading /r/JustFinishedReading /r/TrueBooksFinally, there are subreddits devoted to specific series or authors, like /r/lotr or /r/KingKillerChronicle .(if none of those float your boat, check out a full list [here][link]
763	Shuyao Zhou	1	Hmm, I'll poke around and see if I can find some good book recommendations - most of my stuff is sci-fi and fantasy. You might venture over to /r/books or /r/whattoreadwhen and check with their librarians! \^^
764	Shuyao Zhou	1	Opened the movie, skipped to the random point and the one enacting shakuni delivers the dialogue "yudhishthira has one weakness, he loves gambling". Loves gambling!!! I am pretty sure it is a wrong claim, don't watch it.
765	Shuyao Zhou	3	I will be messaging you in 4 days on to remind you of [**this link**][link]
766	Shuyao Zhou	1	r/whattoreadwhen is kinda slow, but could work as well
767	Shuyao Zhou	1	Idk I’ve been doing a 52 book challenge on r/52book for like 8ish years now. It’s mainly a way to make myself carve out time for reading. The first year was definitely a stretch and these days I don’t always make it to 52, sometimes more sometimes less, but it has been a great way to keep up a good habit.
768	Shuyao Zhou	3	The German sociologist Dominik Schrage wrote a genealogy of consumption called *Die Verfügbarkeit der Dinge* in 2009. While the book has not yet received an English translation, Schrage has at least published a [short summary][link]A classic that nobody has recommended so far - and that you are probably aware of anyway - but which I thought worth mentioning is Pierre Bourdieu's *Distinction*. An earlier classic well worth a read is Georg Simmel. Most of his *oeuvre* might prove a useful tool to make sense of the urbanization processes and accompanying lifestyle changes during the late 19th and early 20th century - and, given that Walter Benjamin had extensively read Simmel (cf. Marian Mičko, *Walter Benjamin und Georg Simmel*) it might be worth reading alongside Benjamin's *Arcades*. A good primer on Simmel's theories and their usefulness in literary studies is Julie Choi's [link]. (As I can imagine that you either already have read or will be reading Theodore Dreiser's *Sister Carrie*, you might also be interested in Ulfried Reichardt's "[Counting Success and Measuring Value: Money, Numbers, and Abstraction in Theodore Dreiser's 'Sister Carrie'][link]" in which he reads *Sister Carrie* through (and alongside) Georg Simmel's *Philosophy of Money*.)Two of Simmel's essays that immediately came to my mind are "The Metropolis and Mental Life" and "[Fashion][link]". In the former, Simmel explores the differences in social relations and individual psyche between rural and urban areas and - among other things - argues, that the city dweller has to become increasingly excentric as not to vanish in the anonymous crowds of the metropolis. In the latter - which might be especially useful whenever shopping practices revolve around clothing and/or the pursuit of changing trends - Simmel postulates that fashion is a form of imitation and so of social equalization, but, paradoxically, in changing incessantly, it differentiates one time from another and one social stratum from another. It unites those of a social class and segregates them from others. (Simmel 541)You might also want to cross-post to r/AskLiteraryStudies, if you haven't done so already.
769	Shuyao Zhou	2	r/books gave you permission to post this on r/AskLiteraryStudies ?
770	Shuyao Zhou	1	I know, that makes me so sad. :(  Can you imagine her poor boyfriend innocently getting excited over a movie and sharing his excitement with his friend, only to have her shit all over it for no reason as he wasn't even talking to her about it?  Geez, she probably ruined the film for him.  And is going to make him now second-guess bringing up other movies to his friends because he's worried he's annoying them, too.
771	Shuyao Zhou	1	Oh I'm not sure, you can try asking at r/askliterarystudies
772	Shuyao Zhou	1	Already done it mate, been Post Menopausal for \`\`10yrs, just didn't turn me into a lying whiny bitch like scummo.Tuesday- bookclub day on r/perth, the second worst day of work, one of the days you change your undies in the morning, your bin night.

775	Shuyao Zhou	2	There's nothing petty about avoiding a person that behaves in bad ways.  **You aren't petty.  You deserve better than this.  You are setting up ways to protect yourself and detach yourself from the situation.**  I would distance yourself from both Josh, and from any discussions about Josh, except for reporting incidents.  I would also look into a decent lock on your bedroom door, so you can have privacy and protect your stuff.   And when you are done with school, I would look into the booklists on these subs and start to read about toxic people and toxic homes and learn how living there has affected you, and how to process and heal from it all.
776	Shuyao Zhou	1	Hey you should join r/52book if you've not already. I joined last year with the intention of reading 12 in a year and made it to 62. It was a great place to find new suggestions to read.
777	Shuyao Zhou	3	To summon this bot, the first line of your comment should be: /u/user_history_bot USERNAME
778	Shuyao Zhou	2	Right here is why they don't tell you anything. Never had to learn the lesson of "don't post anything online you wouldn't want your parents to hear" cus I already learned not to tell the parents anything I didn't want 14 Facebook pages and the Friday Church bookclub to know about
779	Shuyao Zhou	3	The best place to post your list is r/52book
780	Shuyao Zhou	1	Fingers crossed! :D
781	Shuyao Zhou	3	I apologize for being overly aggressive in my comment. Maybe because English isn’t your native language, your post came across as egotistic. What struck a nerve was that you were separating people into categories of intelligent and not intelligent and seemed to imply that the latter has nothing you could benefit from. This may not be what you meant, that’s just how it sounded.
782	Shuyao Zhou	3	Life is a journey of ups and downs, twists and turns, and everything in between. Watch Blake Belladonna as she navigates this uncertain road from start to finish, child to woman and more. She'll love and hate, lose and gain, and find out just how important family is in a world that does all it can to tear you down. Ladybug, Freezerburn on the side. Cover art by booksandweapons.
783	Shuyao Zhou	2	I agree with this 100%. All of the friends I made in college were in different majors than me! I hated the other history students! I joined a bookclub at my college and at the public library as well.
784	Shuyao Zhou	3	Euphuism is a peculiar mannered style of English prose. It takes its name from a prose romance  by John Lyly. It consists of a preciously ornate and sophisticated style, employing a deliberate excess of literary devices such as antitheses, alliterations, repetitions and  rhetorical questions. Classical learning and remote knowledge of all kinds are displayed.
785	Shuyao Zhou	2	Go to r/bookdiscussion
786	Shuyao Zhou	2	Ah, The Jungle. That was the first book I decided I didn’t have to finish. I’ll tell you when I quit reading it when you’re done. As far how the reading goes, if you just want to discuss the book once we’ve finished, I think we can just post on r/52book. If you want to have an ongoing discussion as we read, we might need a different sub.  r/Buddyread is a pretty empty sub and that might work for us as it’s uncluttered.
787	Shuyao Zhou	3	Here's a direct link to this group's recommended book list: [link]Since the group's own list is just at the beginning stage (only a few books listed there) here are some themed lists I've put together over the years that might interest you: [link]
788	Shuyao Zhou	1	Yep, it's never a bad idea to read through a sub's rules before posting:
789	Shuyao Zhou	2	r/badliterature r/askliterarystudies r/literature (the third one is only okay.) for some humor check out r/badreads (bad book reviews) and r/bookscirclejerk (making fun of the (mostly) morons on r/books). i also like r/bookcollecting cause a lot of cool rare books get posted and you can silently judge people’s personal libraries.
790	Shuyao Zhou	1	You’re gonna hate me for saying this, but he did visit a pyramid.
791	Shuyao Zhou	1	Aydra Richards is a fairly new regency HR author with ~600 total Goodreads ratings across her six published books. /u/Curious-Monk-6489 gave her a rec here, but I still wasn't expecting too much. Though some elements of her writing style took a bit of getting used to, I was shocked at how good the book was overall. I've since read most of her back catalogue and they are all home runs. I read a lot of regency historicals and I think she is now in my top three favourite authors in the category.
792	Shuyao Zhou	2	Indeed. I could see something of an argument for that if the OP has only listened NADDPOD C2, but even in that, everybody generally gets a good amount of screen time on NADDPOD. I can not make any definitive statement as to how she is on 8-Bit Bookclub, but given that the OP calls NADDPOD “her (Emily’s) show” makes me think he has listened to neither, as yes, NADDPOD is very much  equally everyone on it’s show as well.
793	Shuyao Zhou	2	We found about 95%of level K books at our library.  But we also have a spectacular library system. The booklists for LG and BYL are both available for free on their websites without purchasing the curriculum
794	Shuyao Zhou	1	Wow, that is really super helpful from a subreddit called "AskLiteraryStudies". Go fuck yourself.
795	Shuyao Zhou	1	Join a club on meetup! Every time I have moved cities I have joined a bookclub and made new friends!
796	Shuyao Zhou	2	Definitely! Here’s my list….            -only read what you enjoy. If a books not doing it for you put it down. You can always give it another chance later.            -find a quite dim spot with minimal distractions. I always read in bed at night because that’s when everyone else is asleep and won’t interrupt me.          -cut out tv/streaming. Seems weird at first but once you get into a good book tv loses its appeal.            -get rid of social media. Especially FB. It’s just designed to bait you into arguments anyway. I make exceptions for book related platforms like Reddit or Bookstagram. It’s been 3 years and I don’t miss a single thing about FB.-buy cheap used books or use the library. That way you can sift through a wide variety of books for minimal monies. Some used book shops have mint condition books for $4.-join in on the r/52book subreddit. That’s what motivated me to start reading more and it’s been a lot of fun over the years. I found great recommendations and had some really good interactions with other Redditors                -always carry a book with you. You never know when you’ll find an extra 15 minutes to read. And all those little chunks really add up. I did that less in 2021 and you can see the above results.              Those are my main bookish habits that keep me reading at a high rate. Even at 100+ books it doesn’t feel like I’m forcing myself. It’s just reading for pleasure. I hope that helps!
797	Shuyao Zhou	3	Winner of the prestigious Gold Dagger Award in the U.K. for the best mystery of 1999, this complex literary thriller may be one of the most satisfying suspense novels to come along in some time. Robert Wilson has written several political thrillers, most of which are set in West Africa, but they are, alas, largely unavailable in the U.S.In A Small Death in Lisbon, the narrative switches back and forth between 1941 and 1999, and Wilson's wide knowledge of history and keen sense of place make the eras equally vibrant. In 1941 Germany, Klaus Felsen, an industrialist, is approached by the SS high command in a none-too-friendly manner and is "persuaded" to go to Lisbon and oversee the sale--or smuggling--of wolfram (also known as tungsten, used in the manufacture of tanks and airplanes). World War II Portugal is neutral where business is concerned, and too much of the precious metal is being sold to Britain when Germany needs it to insure that Hitler's blitzkrieg is successful.

799	Shuyao Zhou	2	I use goodreads, and look at what "lists" the book I like is on, browse by genre, etc.  I also like to go on here and read the /r/booksuggestions or /r/whattoreadwhen .  If i have something specific I want I post but usually I find posts that other people have written that I can relate to as well.
800	Shuyao Zhou	1	It is a horrible game if you were looking for L.A.NOIRE style mystery solving game where the thrill is in the act of putting the pieces of mystery back together in a climactic showdown. I sincerely think you should drop it. Forcing yourself through would be a massive boring waste of time, like being forced to read latin literature about some ancient dead guys you don't care about.
801	Shuyao Zhou	3	I really have no trouble with finding what next to read, on the contrary, so I'll try and share a few tips.Goodreads - their recommendation algorithm sucks, so don't use it. You can use it in 3 ways:- seeing what your friends read - this one is most valuable to me. I know what I respect in other people reading habits, so when I see something they like, I will take notice of it.-book lists - these are not as useful, but I take a look sometime- blog posts - they occasionally have cool blog posts listing books, so I take a look at that, and sometimes find something interestingReddit:- /r/booklists - check occasionally and see what you like- see what other people read on this subreddit
802	Shuyao Zhou	2	This is why I joined Reddit, /r/booksuggestions, /r/suggestmeabook, /r/52book. After I spent some time learning there, a visit to the library or a real bookstore feels like a trip to Disneyland.
803	Shuyao Zhou	1	Interestingly enough, almost this exact question has come up before. The answers there may be of use. There are a few flippant comments, but most are helpful
804	Shuyao Zhou	3	So even when a patient gets a UTI, the treatment is not a circumcision. The treatment is a simple round of antibiotics. Keep in mind that removing body parts is considered the absolute last resort, to be entertained only when all other options are exhausted. And that's for when pathology is actually present. Doing it beforehand is honestly bizarre when we're dealing with someone else's genitals. It's the most private and personal body part.
805	Shuyao Zhou	3	this sub has a few recommended booklists in the sidebar [link]
806	Shuyao Zhou	1	Check out r/heathenry wiki for Nordic booklists. Check out r/broomclosetwitch wiki for links to free PDF libraries and booklists.
807	Shuyao Zhou	3	We have chosen to allow book discussion, but only on designated threads. So if you want to discuss the books or any spoilers from them, you should make a separate post on the subreddit and flag it as [BookDiscussion/BookSpoilers]. We want to wall off the books from the rest of the discussions here.
808	Shuyao Zhou	3	**[Gilbert schema for Ulysses][link] This schema for the novel Ulysses was produced by its author, James Joyce, in November 1921 in order to help his friend, Valery Larbaud, prepare a public lecture on the novel, which Joyce was still writing at the time. The lecture took place on 7 December 1921 at the Maison des Amis des Livres bookshop and lending library, owned and run by Adrienne Monnier. The schema was shown to intimates of Joyce during the 1920s and was eventually published by Stuart Gilbert in 1930 in his book, James Joyce’s “Ulysses”: A Study. Gilbert’s typed copy of the schema is housed in the Harley K. Croessmann Collection of James Joyce at Southern Illinois University Carbondale.

813	Shuyao Zhou	2	You've really reminded me how disorganized and in shambles my reading lists are right now. That's cool you have a good system. Any suggestions for finding good booklists? I'll have to check out Goodreads.Totally, it's after the movie or book that I want to know other people's thoughts and takeaways - once I have my own understanding and base to compare that knowledge and information with.Video games are almost the best medium to do this with, I've found. I'm not sure if you're much of a gamer, but I'll go ahead and say my bit anyway.... Because it's an actively engaging experience - as in you're not just letting the story wash over you - your inputs, ideas, and decisions will directly alter and affect the experience you have with the media and impact your experience heavier. The better the game, the more so (or completely) I will run it without looking at wikis, forums, or videos of it. Even for more mechanical based games: like survival, management, or strategy games; I prefer to go in blind (other than what's shown on the store page) because I'll still play those types of games with an rpg mindset and build a bit of a story and world in my mind as I go. And the failures I "achieve" and extra time wandering because of this add to my time spent. I'm not much of a min/maxer, I guess is what I'm saying, lol.
814	Shuyao Zhou	3	Morris's filter was, as Bossio says, his interpretation of trends. Because it was not a meta-analysis. So it's highly dependent on what Morris thinks and wants to use as sources.

824	Shuyao Zhou	1	Wonderful work on this! I've been looking forward to listening to this album for a while, and I really enjoyed doing so alongside your piece!1. I think relatively joyful? It has a lightness to it even though it deals with some heavier topics.2. I haven't listened to her previous work, sorry! I never knew she wrote *Crying in H-Mart* though lol.3. I do think it works cohesively, really quite well actually. Yes it explores but there's a tether that makes the songs feel connected as well. I really liked the sound on Posing for Cars-- that sort of dream-rock vibe really fits her I think.4. I think that her book must have helped, because even though I've yet to read it, it's showed up on so many booklists lately. Other than that I honestly have no idea how some artists achieve the levels of popularity they do.5. I loved Posing in Bondage and Posing for Cars. Those were both really beautiful!
825	Shuyao Zhou	2	Join a bookclub, awards/contests on wattpad so it gets visible for more people and you also receive feedback for your story and simultaneously connect with other writers!
826	Shuyao Zhou	2	I really like your advice on building your own syllabus - you give some pointers, but it's often difficult to do without an expert instructor. Do you have any further concrete advice? I give some in [my own comment][link], which basically boils down to three pieces of advice (1. look up other people's syllabi; 2. use anthologies, reader's guides, books on themes, introductory books, and books with good study questions; 3. read on the literary criticism and historical context around a particular work), but I'm interested if you'd like to expand further.
827	Shuyao Zhou	2	Piggybacking off your comment, could we please have a what to read if list as well for the more popular books that are recommended in this sub?
828	Shuyao Zhou	2	 Maybe try r/52book? I use Goodreads to set my reading goal for the year and track everything. Other than that, I make time to read every day. Usually at night before bed and on lunch breaks. More on the weekends. I read 81 books this year. I was thinking of trying for 100 but that might be a big stretch and I’m afraid I’d try to read only short books, which would limit the books I want to read that are long. I think maybe having a goal based on number of pages read would be neat too. I read less pages in 2021 than I did in 2020, despite that I read two books more in 2021 than I did the previous year.

847	Shuyao Zhou	2	Shameless plug of my answer to a similar question on r/AskLiteraryStudies a few weeks back:You might want to have a look at the late Mary Oliver's Poetry Handbook --- which I have read and liked --- or at The Making of a Poem: A Norton Anthology of Poetic Forms, edited by Mark Strand and Eavan Boland --- which I haven't read but would recommend solely based on my love for all things Norton!  If there were an English translation of Christoph Bode's Einführung in die Lyrikanalyse, I would tell you to disregard everything else and go for that one. Unfortunately, to my knowledge, only his introduction to prose writing has been translated as of yet (Christoph Bode - The Novel: An Introduction). Bode's books are some of the most enjoyable student's guides to literary studies I have come across.

851	Shuyao Zhou	3	My post is not a request for a "personalized" recommendation. It's not asking for a recommendation for one or more undetermined books based on criteria I list. It's a question of whether a specific book gets better.
852	Shuyao Zhou	3	I'm going to have to disagree with you. Honestly, I think this sub has a habit of hyping up James and Sirius when we don't know much about their intellect. All we really know is that they cast the Homunculus Charm (to create the Marauders Map), became Animagi along with Pettigrew, were sure they aced the DADA exam, and weren't studying in between exams. Honestly, unless Slughorn was just hyping Lily up, her talent seems a bit more impressive, although she doesn't have many actual achievements to back her.As for whether Hermione or James and Sirius were smarter, I think Hermione wins out. Even assuming that they weren't studying at all throughout their Hogwarts years and that they got top grades in all subjects (assertions with little to no canonical basis), Hermione's shown to learn insanely quick. IIRC, a week before they left for Hogwarts, they gathered their course books, but by the time they were on train, she was already months into the curriculum and practicing the Summoning Charm. And then a month or two after that, she learned fifth year-level material and was taking O.W.L practice tests. Not only that, but before her first year, she only had approximately 6 weeks to read her course books (since from CoS, we know students receive booklists for their corresponding year all at the same time), but by the time she met Harry and Ron on the train, she had them all memorized, along with tons of history books, and was casting simple spells on her first try (and they only learned their first charm in class on Halloween). I know that it's a bit counterintuitive to say that the girl who's always studying is a quicker learner than slackers who get similar scores, but I think people forget Hermione generally isn't focused on learning the basic material. It's frequently commented on in the books that when they're doing homework, Hermione takes piles of large books on the topic in areas they're not even touching on. Adding on the fact that she reads up on tons of subjects that the school doesn't cover (alchemy, dark magic, healing, protective enchantments, memory charms, etc.), it makes a lot of sense why she's constantly reading. The only time she's actually  studying the basic material is a few weeks before the exams, but, to me, that says more about her personality than her actual intellect. I used to be a slacker with top grades in every subject, but I knew one person who was always studying, and even though they got the same grades as me, it was obvious to me that they were much more naturally intelligent. Although that guy could have been a slacker and get the same grades, he was an anxious perfectionist, so his mindset led him to study much harder than the people who actually needed to study. The idea that slackers with top grades are always smarter than studiers with the same grades (even when the studier has better feats in terms of learning new material) is demonstrably false.
853	Shuyao Zhou	1	Congratulations!  So far, I'm having a great time, I hope you enjoy parenthood too.
854	Shuyao Zhou	1	I don't have 1000+ manga and I only buy small batches that I can reasonably read at a given time, so I mostly keep track in my head. I do record it on the goodreads app when I finish reading something (gotta meet my yearly), but not when I just buy something. There have been a few times when I've forgotten which books I have in a series, but that's always been because I haven't read all that I have for that series, which is a sign that I lost interest and don't need to buy more of it at this time.I feel like the people who lose track and double buy books are usually the compulsive spenders who just buy 50+ book hauls to have and not to read. Usually when I place orders (or plan out my shopping list for in person buying), I am at home and can reference my collection for any books I am unsure about.  If someone just has trouble with detail and attention with remembering their collections, there are apps like goodreads and a few others (I don't  know them, but have seen them mentioned in this subreddit) they can use when they are out and about or just for quick reference before they hit the checkout screen to keep track.
855	Shuyao Zhou	2	I know that you're specifically asking for the opinion of a _historian_, but your question lies at the intersection of literature and history. An academic trained in language and literature might find some parts of your question easier to weigh in on with authority. You might benefit from posing this to r/AskLiteraryStudies, too.
856	Shuyao Zhou	2	I use a combination of Excel and Goodreads.
857	Shuyao Zhou	1	yeah i mean idk why advertise using stickers if the stickers dont actually give any reference for where or when the “bookclub” takes place :|
858	Shuyao Zhou	1	Late to the party this week, my daughter was sick and we ended up having to go to the hospital Saturday night so my weekend was practically book free. Add in the fact that I wasn't really enjoying the audiobook I'd been listening to and just a general reading slump and I only finished one book this past week.The audiobook, **Tell me an Ending** was, similar to Parzival pretty disappointing. I provided some word-vomit thoughts [here][link], but in summary the book felt like a slog, the characters were boring and the blurb was misleading. 
859	Shuyao Zhou	1	Not going to entertain any request to educate people on what racism is or point out specific examples of racism. You guys can go down internet rabbit holes and find any information you need about anything. Why suddenly whenever it comes to race, you forget that skill and need handholding?
860	Shuyao Zhou	2	I think it's weirder than that. I feel like there are some incredibly persuasive women out there managing to get money from a rich guy without giving up their bodies. As in, a little flirtation, but mostly companionship.
861	Shuyao Zhou	2	There's [A Different Sort of Normal][link] by Abigail Balfe. It's a heavily illustrated memoir. It's aimed at the middle-grade level (BookTrust suggests age 9+), but I remember being a five-year-old reading way above my nominal level, so I'm not about to gatekeep! :-) It talks about autism, and about what it's like growing up autistic (without knowing that's what you're doing). It might not be quite what you're after, but do take a look; even if you decide it's not right for your son, you might well enjoy it yourself.Bonus: Reading to the end of that article, I discovered that BookTrust have an ["Autism" list][link]: children's and YA books featuring characters on the autistic spectrum. I haven't read them so don't know if any of them would suit, but hopefully someone else here will, or you'll be able to find helpful reviews somewhere.
862	Shuyao Zhou	1	Right, well Sylvia Plath isn't a philosopher, so I'd suggest asking somewhere like /r/AskLiteraryStudies/ or /r/askliterature or /r/sylviaplath or somewhere more like that.
863	Shuyao Zhou	1	YTA. I had to go back and reread the ages because I thought for sure you were 17 given how silly the fight you started was. He was not talking to you he was talking to someone else on the phone. Stop acting like a child. The world does not revolve around you. If your boyfriend wants to talk about the movie with someone else he can. You just need to butt out of a conversation you were not involved or invited into. No one asked your opinion or involved you in any way so why exactly do you have a right to be mad here?
864	Shuyao Zhou	1	Welcome to /r/ExplainAFilmPlotBadly. In order to ensure that everyone has read the rules and mods can stop removing posts that break them, we are requiring additional approvals for new users before their posts will show up in the subreddit.
865	Shuyao Zhou	1	I’ve just started reading along M with r/bookclub this month - really enjoying it so far. Tend to read around 4-6 books a month, with check ins every week or so to discuss.
866	Shuyao Zhou	2	Check out the weekly suggestions thread(should be stickied), the mod recommendation in the sidebar, /r/booksuggestions , or  /r/whattoreadwhen
867	Shuyao Zhou	1	Have you asked this question from a previous account, or has there been a glitch in the matrix?
868	Shuyao Zhou	2	The subreddit is titled ‘AskLiteraryStudies’.That’s what the OP did. If you want, start a subreddit called ‘Don’tAskResearchQuestionsYouCouldGoogle’. Your indignation when confronted with a similar polite request will then be appropriate.
869	Shuyao Zhou	3	No, but you need to offer more than just a book list to get the discussion going. No low quality book lists. To maintain quality, the list must encourage discussion. For linked lists the list itself must have descriptive paragraphs for each book. Users are also encouraged to submit their own unique lists as a self/text-post. Original lists should have at least a paragraph explaining the reason for the list and include some further thoughts on at least a few of the books. The poster must have actually read each book. Alternatively, there is /r/booklists.If you are just curious about others' answers the question has been asked in the past and you can find those threads by using the search.
870	Shuyao Zhou	1	We are reading this over at r/bookclub. You should come check out the discussions. We read to Chapter IX this week. I hope you like the book. It took me a few chapters to get into it, but now I am really digging the characters and the world :)
871	Shuyao Zhou	3	Please edit your post to hide those book spoilers. Thanks.
872	Shuyao Zhou	2	Nice job!! You may want to check out r/52book, they share a lot of content like this.
873	Shuyao Zhou	2	Work on your readers’ advisory (RA)! You can create booklists based on authors, subjects, moods, read alikes (for books and also for tv/movies), or so many other things. For books you’re not actually interested in reading, you can [read a book in 5 minutes][link]
874	Shuyao Zhou	1	A big yes on this one! Quality, age appropriate historical fiction will do wonders in all these areas! Make sure they are interesting, not dry. There are booklists to help you on the web. Let him enjoy reading alone and together. You can include your kindergartener as well - older can read to the younger, vice versa as the younger gets older,  and you can read to both. Fun unit studies and comprehension activities can be built around them. You will look back at this precious family time with fondness and have built strong reading/writing skills in your children.
875	Shuyao Zhou	1	Congrats on the new Job! Also finding your content and hearing about bookclub and everyone posting memes really brought out a lot of good laughs I had even though it was just through the internet lol, Hopefully more content comes soon. &lt;3
876	Shuyao Zhou	2	I forgot to mention the local group responsible that i referred to has national funding from conservative groups and is of course also fighting CRT and LGBQI and anti-mask anti-vax issues in every form. They are so coordinated they actually have a volunteer program for "how to get books removed from libraires" where they have PowerPoints, booklists, and local chapter meetings. The trainings include enlisting children to check out every book on the list from libraries and then just not returning them (or just stealing them, as long as you're righteous in doing so), how to personally harrass board members and librarians, demand librarians be fired, instructs them to go to board meetings and read out of context paragraphs from books to illicit outrage, tells them they should avoid reading the books themselves because they are too disturbing ("trust us, we've read them all") coaches them on verbiage like to make sure to not say the word "banned" but use other synonyms in its place, to use words like "pornography" in order to quote public pornography laws, as if that is applicable, and my personal favorite- call the police. They literally put out a press release instructing their 20k followers to locate these books in libraries, and call police and file police reports for pornography and public indecency. 
877	Shuyao Zhou	3	In the Skin of a Jihadist: A Young Journalist Enters the Isis Recruit Network, by Anna Erelle** is an amazing story of a Muslim journalist who went undercover posing as a USA Muslim Girl to a member of IsIs. She was trying to gain information about how they were recruiting youth in order to help an organization that intervenes in deradicalizing youth. She was unknowingly being tapped by the NSA, and the information they gained from her was used to take out a high ranking member. It’s an amazing story.
878	Shuyao Zhou	2	I enjoy looking at r/52book to see what people are reading.Somewhere in the sidebar menu or wiki of r/books there is a list of book subreddits.
879	Shuyao Zhou	2	This got touched on a little in [this recent discussion] [link], with some examples.

882	Shuyao Zhou	2	A wild ride stuffed to the cut-lines with humor, heart, and space shenanigans.May’s humdrum life gets flung into hyperdrive when she’s abducted, but not all aliens are out to probe her. She’s inadvertently rescued by Xan who’s been orbiting Earth in a day-glo orange rocket ship, watching re-runs of “I Love Lucy”. Seizing the opportunity for a better life, May learns how to race the Audacity and pilots her way into interstellar infamy. Finally, she has a job she likes and a friend to share her winnings with—until the Goddess of Chaos screws the whole thing up, and Xan’s unmentionable past makes a booty call.

884	Shuyao Zhou	3	I would check the 1859 letter (essay) on art.  It's written as if it were a letter convincing a Salon to search for a certain type of artist.  I would not wager my life on it, and i'm not going to go through the letter in French to find it for a person, because it's 100 pages and my French is intermediate.In general, Baudelaire took this from Kant.  Romantics he cites that I can remember are mostly Kant and Emerson.That said, this could be one of the earlier letters, I think 1854 or 1855 are the way the other two are remembered, because later in his life Baudelaire seemed less eager to call himself or people he admired romantics and started focusing on decadence more explicitly.Honestly, this one quote is basically restated in several different parts of his critical work.  You may be able to find a look-a-like quote that does say what you've said exactly but that focuses on the impression or senses rather than the object.That the word "modern" is used explicitly makes me also think that this comes from the 1859 letter.  You may have better luck in r/AskLiteraryStudies .
885	Shuyao Zhou	1	A Christmas Carol, Crime and Punishment. Look for books with redemption arches.  Found you this thread - https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/36ki6d/who_are_some_of_the_most_well_known_heroes_who/
886	Shuyao Zhou	1	This is so awesome, is it from a Fritz Lang movie?
887	Shuyao Zhou	2	Yes, however you are right, you should probably educate yourself because if you go in without the education that is for sure when your ignorance (not to be mean or anything, just stating that's how it is since you don't have the exposure) would detract from the progresses being made in spaces of activism, read up on the history (it will help you understand everything better including your racial identity) and anti-racism. There are a ton of booklists and recommendations that come up when you look for one or two on Goodreads and Amazon. If you want even, I'm pretty sure you could get the audio books for them.
888	Shuyao Zhou	1	This gets me too. I've slowly started dwindling out of the WDYR posts because of how annoying it is to see the post information for that week be something like "DNF after 2 pages into sample because ....." I know I DNF anytime but it's not a weekly recurrence to DNF every single book, most of the time in the sample downloaded first chapters. Recently there was one where the only book tried and DNF was the FF Bookclub pick of the month. Could you not bring negative publicity to 1. a queer (f/nb) romance that already has a slim chance of getting recognition 2. a book you didn't read and 3. have it as the image that pops up on the most frequented post as a DNF associated with not being good.Just having someone else post that WDYR recurring post would be fantastic. Other mods are definitely reading and can actually contribute to the conversations. .... sorry, apparently i'm passionate about the picky WDYR posts lol.
889	Shuyao Zhou	1	I'm gonna say for newreadersAvengers by BuisiekAvengers by BendisAvengers by Aaron
890	Shuyao Zhou	1	Exactly what I'm talking about. Every nation has to a certain degree a bias towards itself.I can't watch most war movies from the US as they are full of patriotism. The Vietnam movies are generally better in that regard, as the war was always seen very critically but I literally can't think of WWII movie where the soldiers are shown in a bad light. The worst thing I remember seeing is them killing POWs (but as they are Wehrmacht soldiers, who cares?) but I can't even think of one movie where a soldier rapes a woman of a liberated town or something similar atrocious.
891	Shuyao Zhou	1	Booklists, my favorite thing to share! I've been jotting titles down as they came to me.  Standing trigger warning for these, as everything RBB-relatable that has the potential to give solace also has the potential to trigger, a couple have SA content handled with sensitivity.. *Fiction* isa Tuttle, The Silver Bough Maggie O'Farrell, Hamnet T.H. White's The Once and Future King, especially The Queen of Air and Darkness Jude Morgan, PassionSusan Palwick, Shelter, Flying in Place Angela Carter, The Magic Toyshop Ursula LeGuin, GiftsGoodnight Mr Tom, Michelle Magorian Elizabeth Wein, The Winter Prince and the rest of her Lionhunters series. Maureen McHugh, Mothers and Other Monsters--worth it for the title alone :p--and all the rest of her her excellent novels. ...and Diana Wynne Jones.  Pretty much everything she wrote explores RBB themes and characters through the prism of story.
892	Shuyao Zhou	3	To get revenge on King Mildred, Grizelda creates the fiercest dragon the kingdom has ever seen.  He is such a terror that he must be killed. Now if only the dragonslayers could stop arguing long enough to face the greatest battle of all!
893	Shuyao Zhou	1	100 percent agree. I see the same garbage from some people talking about NADPOD and I’m pretty sure I even saw it once in a conversation about her old podcast 8 bit bookclub. It’s gross.

895	Shuyao Zhou	3	Not something I've heard about or have got an impression of. The BBC does not only use RP speakers these days, but the newreaders they do use tend to eliminate anything that might be considered a regionalism but maintain their native phonemic realisation for the most part. It could well be possible that you heard a newsreader who wasn't even from the South of England, perhaps the Midlands, but didn't stand out as such due to the toned down nature of the regional accents the BBC allows. It's not uncommon for middle class speakers in the Midlands and even the North to sound little different from middle class southerners bar lacking some of the more pronounced features like the trap-bath split, extensive diphthong smoothing, and more extensive use of schwa. This is particularly true of the generation who grew up at a time when regional accents were frowned upon by the middle class to a greater degree.Historically, the geographic region where the trap-bath split is prevalent has already shrunk. It used to encompass much of the Midlands including Birmingham, but merged over time during the 20th century most likely due to the class association.
896	Shuyao Zhou	1	While many of my favourites are already mentioned (Gunnerkrigg Court, Wilde Life, Kill Six Billion Demons, Homestuck) i haven't seen [Monster Pulse](https://www.monster-pulse.com/newreaders) here yet. By Mangolia Porter Siddell it tells the story of kids whose organs get turned into monsters due to a secret project, and how that affects their lives. The art constantly evolves, the characterisations are great, there is good character drama and action, it goes some messed up places and doesn't shy away from some serious consequences from the premise and it regularly updates! Close to being finished even! I can only reccommend it.
897	Shuyao Zhou	3	Civility is one our rules, please be sure to keep that in mind with all comments and posts. Insulting people isn't in line with that rule.
898	Shuyao Zhou	2	I’m just calling it a buddy read for lack of a better term— I was a teacher and that’s what it was called when you’d pair two readers to tackle a book together. I’m kind of hoping that as we go along this year we’ll find other people who will feel like joining us so I’m fine with not setting too much in stone. For me it would be ideal though if we can have a few (three- five) titles planned in advance because I’ll be doing other reading besides what we’re doing together and that will help with my time management. What if you just make a post about Emma here in r/52book whenever you’ve finished it and tag me in the comments? I’ll have it read by Saturday night. 
899	Shuyao Zhou	2	Hi, it looks like you're trying to summon u/goodreads-bot. Unfortunately, they don't play nicely with me or the r/Fantasy Golem family, so they're not welcome here. Please resubmit your comment.
900	Shuyao Zhou	2	Setting a goal and posting my progress on r/52book has helped me stay on track. I wanted to read more the year before but this has provided more accountability for me.
901	Shuyao Zhou	3	Please post lists of books in /r/booklists.

905	Shuyao Zhou	2	Last year I read 55 books and probably 15-20 I got from this sub or from books posted on r/52book. Thank you everyone.
906	Shuyao Zhou	1	as someone who works at a place like this: dont leave it to the last week before school goes back. booklists are sent out november/early december. unless you are new to the state or changing school with little notice, be prepared. if you order early, we will have stock, we will have it sent out on time (or if you shop in store there will not be long waits), and you will be happy. and ESPECIALLY do not be one of those people that orders late, doesnt get their stuff in time for start of term and decides to call customer service to abuse the poor high school aged kids old on the phones working hard their summer holiday.
907	Shuyao Zhou	3	The descending numbers on the left tell you what printing the book is. You have a seventh and a tenth printing shown. If the number line is something like 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1, it's a first printing, 10 9 8 7 6 5 is a fifth printing etc (the number at the beginning doesn't matter). For book collectors, first printings can be highly collectible and for some books, much more valuable than later printings. The reason for this is a first printing run usually doesn't print as many books as later printing runs (because the publisher doesn't necessarily know how popular the book will be), and, because the first printing shows the book text and other features exactly as they originally were when the book was first printed. Later printings may fix mistakes or change things slightly. In addition, if you are interested in the ads at the back of the book, the first printing will show the "current" ads to when the book was published, while later printings show ads from potentially years later. Sometimes you'll also find out interesting trivia from first or earlier printings - for instance, the booklists in the back of the book include titles of upcoming books, and sometimes those titles change when the book is actually published. For instance, 'Werewolf Skin' was originally called 'I want to be a werewolf for Halloween' and you can still see this original title in some of the booklists and/or ads in book #59.For your purposes, there's no important difference between a seventh and a tenth printing, in terms of collectible value or anything else. For some of the earlier Goosebumps books, like books #1-6 where first printings are rare, the first printings might be worth slightly more than others but most Goosebumps collectors don't care, they just want an original series 90s book rather than a reprint. I did sell a first printing of #4 for $20 once, so maybe a few people care. Although, in my experience, usually the first printing is pretty much the same as the second - fifth printing, but if you compared a first printing to a 20th printing, there would be different ads, different booklists, different or no cover ads, etc. (note that for later books, like 50s and 60s, it's almost rarer to find a book that isn't a first printing than one that is, because the later books didn't get many printing runs.)It's also through knowing about first printings that I was able to figure out exactly what month certain publishing changes occurred. You may notice that some Goosebumps books have the ISBN/price on the cover, and some don't. The ISBN/price stopped appearing on the cover starting in November 1995. Any Goosebumps book, including later printings of earlier books, published this month and after doesn't have it. I know this because I have owned first printings of both #36 and #37 (first published in October 1995 and November 1995, respectively) and #36 had it while #37 didn't.
908	Shuyao Zhou	3	Did you happen to check out our rules before posting? Both of your questions are answered there. No low quality book lists. To maintain quality, the list must encourage discussion. For linked lists the list itself must have descriptive paragraphs for each book. Users are also encouraged to submit their own unique lists as a self/text-post. Original lists should have at least a paragraph explaining the reason for the list and include some further thoughts on at least a few of the books. The poster must have actually read each book. Alternatively, there is /r/booklists.
909	Shuyao Zhou	3	r/booklists can be a choice.
910	Shuyao Zhou	3	Once in a great while, we encounter a novel in our voluminous reading that begs to be read aloud. Leif Enger's debut, Peace Like a River, is one such work. His richly evocative novel, narrated by an asthmatic 11-year-old named Reuben Land, is the story of Reuben's unusual family and their journey across the frozen Badlands of the Dakotas in search of his fugitive older brother. Charged with the murder of two locals who terrorized their family, Davy has fled, understanding that the scales of justice will not weigh in his favor. But Reuben, his father, Jeremiah—a man of faith so deep he has been known to produce miracles—and Reuben's little sister, Swede, follow closely behind the fleeing Davy.
911	Shuyao Zhou	1	i can see how that would parcially fit, but not really... I'm looking for a subreddit where they deliberately rate books based on writing technique and plot, and while i imagine r/AskLiteraryStudies would rate that, i would guess people dont usually post there with that in mind... Just more of a on-demand thing
912	Shuyao Zhou	2	I think you'd be better off asking this question in either r/AskLiteraryStudies or r/TrueLit .
913	Shuyao Zhou	2	It was one of the only bookclub books I could get my hands on this month. And I was kind of middling going in, but I really ended up enjoying it.
914	Shuyao Zhou	1	I like the subreddits r/whattoreadwhen and r/books for potential leads into new series and to keep a thumb on the pulse as they say, to what people are enjoying.
915	Shuyao Zhou	1	Does anyone have recommendations for books with elderly main characters? I've seen a few booklists here with middle-aged characters, but I wonder if there are any with characters older than that, grandparents or retirees.
916	Shuyao Zhou	2	Posts asking users to list their favorite/the best book of a genre, style, etc that don't **include an answer and why in the body** will be assumed to be recommendation requests and removed. 'Should I read X book?' and 'What do I need to know before I read X' posts are not allowed unless you have made an effort to encourage discussion, otherwise you might be re-directed to the Weekly Recommendation Thread or [/r/suggestmeabook](https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook).
917	Shuyao Zhou	1	Hahah we read it for my last bookclub, and I was “hate-reading” it by the end. I was so annoyed with it but also had to finish. I didn’t really like any of the characters and I felt like we were rushing through all the husbands without any character development. Waste of 6 hours of my life 😩
918	Shuyao Zhou	3	No.  You're best off taking this to /r/AskLiteraryStudies.
919	Shuyao Zhou	1	When I was a wee lad, all the school booklists were submitted to the school and we picked it up from school. Is this a thing of the past and up to the parents/guardians to chase up before the year starts nowadays?(Don't have my own kids, left school in 1987, I have no idea how things work in regards to schools and schooling)
920	Shuyao Zhou	1	Definitely! Mostly on /r/52book - sometimes a cover catches my eye and makes me want to read it.I still will look up things about the book to confirm it doesn't have content I don't want to read (erotica, etc). But the cover got me interested.
921	Shuyao Zhou	3	/r/books is the general sub, there are plenty of more specific subs if you want something specific* /r/bookbinding* /r/bookcaseporn[link]
922	Shuyao Zhou	1	I get paying an escort. They will leave when you're done, and you don't need to pretend any sort of connection. Sugar Babies are... More insidious. It's like they want the money, but aren't willing to do nearly as much. I get it from their pov, but what are the rich men getting out of it?
923	Shuyao Zhou	1	Yep. Looks like your post violates this rule of that subreddit: Recommendation Requests
924	Shuyao Zhou	4	Usually just reading, reading about what's going on, reading people's thoughts, theories, visions, reading people's diaries, reading all about others, one could say I like reading what other people's shoes are walking about like. Lots of times picking up a conversation, maybe a friend, and sending random acts of cards and r/52book is where I say mostly.
925	Shuyao Zhou	2	Maybe /r/bookdiscussion? A place to discuss books you are currently reading, have recently finished, or would like to talk about in general.Seems low activity, but they have a Discord that might be more active.
926	Shuyao Zhou	2	Girl who do you think you are? If he choose to speak with somebody else about the movie it's nine of your business. He respected what you ask and not had a long conversation WITH YOU. He's a grown man and you really spoke yo him like he's a high school boy. Your definitely TA I can guarantee if he stop going to the movies with you all together you would swear it's an issue. You need to apologize that was so ignorant
927	Shuyao Zhou	1	(Psst this IS the /52book sub!)
928	Shuyao Zhou	1	Hi there. Per [rule 3.3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Books/wiki/rules), please post book recommendation requests in /r/SuggestMeABook or in our Weekly Recommendation Thread. Thank you!
929	Shuyao Zhou	1	Yes!! It’s called ‘Goodreads’, you can track your reading, review books and make booklists, similar to Spotify but with books
930	Shuyao Zhou	2	The whole Krakoa business seemed to make many characters less religuous in favour of whatever mutant religion Nightcrawler is founding.Which I find somewhat sad. An interfaith religious bookclub on Krakoa would have been fun. People sitting around and discussing how ressurections change their world view.
931	Shuyao Zhou	3	I do about 1-2 a week usually. So far I’ve read1. *Samurai* by Michael Wert (nonfiction)2. *The Souls of Black Folk* by WEB Dubois (nonfiction)3. *How Few Remain* by Harry Turtledove (fiction)4. *The Thousand Crimes of Ming Tsu* by Tom Lin (fiction)5. *Shadow Divers* by Robert Kurson (nonfiction)*Thousand Crimes* was a western and it was also really good, so probably my favorite fiction book this year.You should check out /r/52book, it’s a challenge to read at least 1 book a week for a year
932	Shuyao Zhou	3	The Christmas season offers little cheer for Eileen Dunlop, an unassuming yet disturbed young woman trapped between her role as her alcoholic father’s caretaker in a home whose squalor is the talk of the neighborhood and a day job as a secretary at the boys prison, filled with its own quotidian horrors. Consumed by resentment and self-loathing, Eileen tempers her dreary days with perverse fantasies and dreams of escaping to the big city. In the meantime, she fills her nights and weekends with shoplifting, stalking a buff prison guard named Randy, and cleaning up her increasingly deranged father’s messes. When the bright, beautiful, and cheery Rebecca Saint John arrives on the scene as the new counselor at the prison, Eileen is enchanted and proves unable to resist what appears at first to be a miraculously budding friendship. But her affection for Rebecca ultimately pulls her into complicity in a crime that surpasses her wildest imaginings.
933	Shuyao Zhou	3	I read a decent amount of philosophy and academic nonfiction. Philosophy is deceptive, quite a lot of it is dense but on the shorter end 150 pages. Both have a high barrier to entry that becomes easier over time. I just finished rereading Dune last week. If you want some ideas of the books I've read, I will post pictures of them to 52book which you can get from my profile. You can also see what kinds of books I'm doing for this year's challenge and my reviews for them.
934	Shuyao Zhou	1	Ah, thanks! I reposted it here: [link]
935	Shuyao Zhou	1	This argument has been tossed around a few times over at r/52book and similar book related subs.Technically you didn't read it, but you're not going to get knocked for hearing it instead. Audiobooks are acceptable ways to experience a book, and "yes" is an acceptable answer if someone asked if you've read a book. That said, I when someone asks me if I've read a book, and I listened to the audiobook, I'll just answer something like "I heard the audiobook". But it will still count towards my "reading list".One thing that I am peculiar about, is that the experience of an audiobook is sub-par for gripping stories. When you learn to read without an internal monologue, things become more vivid. Similar to seeing a stop sign and knowing to "stop" without having to vocalize the word, reading a book offers a similar experience where you blaze by the words and your mind races with images that come to life.
936	Shuyao Zhou	2	That's nice but still a lot of those are not "general". Thanks for trying I'm going to go through them. /bookdiscussion has been taken over by a spammer. 
937	Shuyao Zhou	2	This is my first year doing the challenge after discovering it, and pairing it with the popsugar prompts has been a fun step outsider what I may usually do. Also I’m trying to train myself that when I’m scrolling Reddit at night if I see a post from /r/books or /r/52book it is time to put down the phone and pick up the kindle.
938	Shuyao Zhou	3	What made this book unique from it’s predecessors is that shortly before it’s release, Martin announced that while working on the book he has reached over 1500 pages and still the book remains unfinished.
939	Shuyao Zhou	1	You should check out r/52book. I am only 8 books in, but am still on track.
940	Shuyao Zhou	1	If "cite-checking" is some kind of jargon that refers to the entire [literature review][link] process, well, *excuse me* for not knowing the jargon -- but *don't* mistake not knowing the jargon for not understanding the process!You may "(a) know just enough to be dangerous about how legislation is made, and (b) am used to dealing with similar levels of complexity" but you clearly don't know what you don't know.Do you realize how fundamentally condescending and hypocritical that sort of attitude is? Apparently, I was wrong before: you *do* mean it that way!
941	Shuyao Zhou	3	It is a cult: „those man made scripts are gods word even if there is no proof whatsoever and if you don’t join my bookclub and continue being who you are (how my god made you essentially?) my loving and merciful god will send you to hell where you will be tortured forever“ The world would be much better off if people would just worship nature instead, but well, this planet and humanity is the way it is unfortunately.
942	Shuyao Zhou	1	Here’s one where you do know what’s going on, but nonetheless … From another reviewer on Goodreads re David Weber’s alien invasion novel *Out of The Dark*:  Up to this point I’d give the novel two out of five stars, maybe two and a half if you like David Weber or military sci-fi. On page 330 a crime is committed against narrative justice and the book drops to below one star. I would break out negative stars for this thing if I could. What is this crime, you ask? Well, on page 330 of a 380 page novel, vampires arrive and kill all the aliens.No, I am not kidding.
943	Shuyao Zhou	1	Unless they are somehow associated with one another,but that's crazy talk,nothing at all like that has,or ever will happen! They are from different states you say? I was gonna say maybe they were all in the same bookclub or knitting circle,but to have associations across state lines is nearly impossible! Jeez,You must be right then,congratulations. And always remember to "play ball". 😉
944	Shuyao Zhou	3	No. I would consider nihilism a state where truth, values, or human purpose is pointless. RDR 2 (the game I have familiarity with; you don't get to pick and choose in r/AskLiteraryStudies) doesn't fit that.Red Dead Redemption 2 would arguably be more existentialist, in the sense that it gives players choices for how to conduct themselves, for how to find purpose and meaning. For instance, you appeal to what you **can** do in the game, but you neglect to address player choice. Players can abstain from murder, robbery, or shooting while free roaming. Players can go entirely pacifist or choose to only defend themselves when attacked. Players can apply their own codes of ethics for how they engage. So it's up to a player whether they want to play as a nihilist. RDR 2 is also arguably more structured than that. Even in free roam, there is a slider (admittedly simple) keeping track of how good or bad Arthur has been, suggesting an objective basis of ethics - the game allows players to do bad but would not let them get away with too much bad, ultimately. Also, story missions are scripted in a way that defines a kind of ethics surrounding the actions of Arthur, Dutch, and the other characters. That they sometimes do cruel things, even in the story, does not mean that values or truth are absent. Indeed, the arc of the story does a pretty good job in putting (for instance) Dutch in his place.So unless someone had a more specific definition of nihilism and a tighter argument for applying it to RDR2, I wouldn't call that game nihilistic.
945	Shuyao Zhou	3	Here are some really good books that I've used over the years:Judika Illes' "Encyclopedia of 5000 Spells."Jason Augustus Newcomb's "The Book of Magick Power."Jason Miller's "The Sorcerer's Secrets."Bill Whitcomb's "The Magician's Reflection" (an excellent handbook for building one's own set of magical correspondences in a meaningful way.)Kenaz Filan &amp; Raven Kaldera's ""Talking to the Spirits" and "Drawing Down the Spirits".Frater U.D.'s "High Magic" and "High Magic II" for a comprehensive training program in magic.I've put together some lists of the better books on specific witchy topics, like working with herbs, protection magic, working with magic energy, etc. over at my own website if anyone is looking for more suggestions: [link]
946	Shuyao Zhou	2	I’m really curious how to read a strap on dildo- is that braille?Would also love if anyone has links to support the Dr.Seuss teacher and or the banned book bookclub.

948	Shuyao Zhou	2	Hey there! Good to meet you.I'm glad to see that, you are will be joining us.[This thread is more appropriate for the community wide introduction thread, created yesterday. So I will remove this thread, and you can introduce yourself, there.][link]The introduction thread, is a yearly thing.Here are some other annual threads, that you might be interested in.[2022 Goodreads User List][link][Yearly Round up- Tips and tricks][link]I'm looking forward to seeing you.
949	Shuyao Zhou	2	Well, on reddit There are 390+ [author, reading, and writing related subs][link]
950	Shuyao Zhou	3	Try asking in the weekly recommendation thread, in /r/suggestmeabook or in /r/whattoreadwhen. All the best.
951	Shuyao Zhou	3	**[Zeugma (Commagene)][link] Zeugma (Greek: Ζεῦγμα) is an ancient Hellenistic era Greek and then Roman city of Commagene; located in modern Gaziantep Province, Turkey. It was named for the bridge of boats, or zeugma, that crossed the Euphrates river at that location. Zeugma Mosaic Museum contains mosaics from the site, and is one of the largest mosaic museums in the world.
952	Shuyao Zhou	1	I'm not trying to determine what can or can't be posted, but /r/ebooks or /r/books or one of the sub-genre threads would probably be better for discussion. You could also consider /r/bookdiscussion and /r/bookrecommendationsIMO, the post still seems like promo though. 
953	Shuyao Zhou	3	If it isn't relevant to the sub, don't post it in the sub.  Go to /r/books, or /r/bookdiscussion.  Doesn't make any sense to know you're posting in the wrong place and do it anyway.
954	Shuyao Zhou	2	My daughter is in 4th grade (9 years old) and she just took her yearly Lexile test (I'm not sure what the test itself is called) and she got a score  range of 1070-1200 which is and 8th-9th grade reading level if I'm reading all the info correctly. Anyway her teacher asked for help finding books in her range so I thought I'd ask on here too. I think maybe non-fiction would be a good change but I have no idea where to even start with that. She loves fantasy fiction but I'm concerned with the content she may start encountering as she moves up into those higher levels. Thanks for your help!!
955	Shuyao Zhou	3	This is the first of three fascinating volumes in which Braudel, the renowned historian and celebrated author of The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World, offers what is in effect an economic and social history of the world from the Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution. Like everything he writes, it is new, stimulating and sparkles like champagne.Braudel's technique, it has been said, is that of a pointilliste. Myriads of separate details, sharp glimpses of reality experienced by real people, are seen miraculously to orchestrate themselves into broad rhythms that underlie and transcend the excitements and struggles of particular periods. Braudel sees the past as we see the present — only in a longer perspective and over a wider field.The perspective is that of the possible, of the actual material limitations to human life in any given time or place. It is the every¬day, the habitual — the obvious that is so obvious it has hitherto been neglected by historians — that Braudel claims for a new and vast and enriching province of history. Food and drink, dress and housing, demography and family structure, energy and technology, money and credit, and, above all, the growth of towns, that powerful agent of social and economic development, are described in all the richness and complexity of real life.[link]

957	Shuyao Zhou	1	Elton is looking very cute! 
958	Shuyao Zhou	1	Read and join or start a bookclub. I totally enjoy the experience of reading a book and discussing it with people from all walks of life afterwards.I don't know how well your relationship with your parents is but you could definitely use the time to connect with them too, maybe even suggest doing activities as a family? :)
959	Shuyao Zhou	1	I understand where you're coming from. Sorry if I reacted a little miffed.I did believe that format by itself would inspire a bit of discussion, even though I was deliberately not expressing a point of view. The less-frequent words in a book exemplify so much of what's extraordinary about a book. They encapsulate the time (in the evolution of the English language), the place, the narrator's rank, the themes... and the treasury of language at large. I thought it was much more interesting to just put it out there and let people react without guidance, than to explain it like a schoolmaster and then let people say: Yes/No/Yes but/No but... I'd find that a little tedious. But, as you've said, if r/books is really r/bookdiscussion than maybe my post wasn't appropriate. Save travels.
960	Shuyao Zhou	2	There's a wide breadth of subject knowledge as well as depth. I need to be an expert in adolescent development, our community, collection management, and project management, among other things. The masters has been very helpful in teaching me how to analyze data to make wise decisions for my community.
961	Shuyao Zhou	3	Have a search and ask around at r/AskLiteraryStudies.
962	Shuyao Zhou	3	Poor Dionis or Poor Dionysus (Romanian: Sărmanul Dionis, originally spelled Sermanul Dionisie; also translated as Wretched Dionysus or The Sorrowful Dionis) is an 1872 prose work by Romanian poet Mihai Eminescu, classified by scholars as either a novel, a novella or a modern fairy tale. It is a liberal interpretation of contemporary German philosophy and ancient motifs, discussing themes such as time travel and reincarnation through the lens of post-Kantian idealism.
963	Shuyao Zhou	2	Like u/roranicusrex, I have a similar reading pattern where I catch up on weekends if I can’t read much through the workweek. I use physical, ebook, and audiobooks, sometimes switching formats for the same book so I can keep “reading” while I’m driving or doing chores at home. (Scribd and the public library are godsends for that). I joined r/52book - a book a week - during the pandemic and dramatically improved my book count from a pathetic 8 in 2019 to 65 in 2020 and I pledge never to go back! It’s the right pastime for me.
964	Shuyao Zhou	3	[link]TPL offers books about Toronto sorted by neighborhood
965	Shuyao Zhou	2	I'm not sure if you were looking for suggestions or for sources but I like the Read Aloud Revival.  She has all kinds of lists of books for different ages, interests, etc.  She does make some gender assumptions so don't be afraid to check out lists for either gender (my son loved the secret garden and little house books, but my daughter wasn't a fan.). I started with my father's dragon with both kids and they loved it
966	Shuyao Zhou	2	1. What specific details are you looking for that you couldn’t find yourself by knowing which curriculum is used? Knowing which curriculum is used would allow you to look at the curriculum website, see examples, booklists, materials, summaries, and you could view the textbooks and teachers manuals by asking at the school. Which “level of detail” are you looking for that wouldn’t be covered by this? To be honest, your dismissal of the importance of which specific curriculum is used doesn’t back up your claims that you have gone through this process yourself. The only additional “level of details” you could get is access to the individually created lesson plans of each teacher, classroom decorations/posters, read aloud books, differentiated worksheets, etc, and it would be ridiculously burdensome and unmanageable and damaging to education to try to require these in advance.2. You claim you sought out information regarding the curriculum at your local district Can you provide the name of the curriculum you disapproved of to back up your claim? Can you explain, specifically, what was in it that you disapproved of?
967	Shuyao Zhou	1	Depends on the season and what players I'm excited about at the moment but I enjoy hanging on r/tennis when they're not being toxic. 😶 I used to visit books but had the same issue as you. Now I'm subbed to r/52book which is less active but gives me some good ideas about what I may want to check out.
968	Shuyao Zhou	3	The same happened with the Scots wiki. Decent enough sentences were posted on Twitter and mocked because words like 'muckle' and 'ken' were unfamiliar to them. How can a language thrive when many of the people to whom it's meant to belong have nothing but embarrassment over it?
969	Shuyao Zhou	3	If this doesn't make sense, please reply with more than a one-word question so I have a better idea of what is confusing you about this.
970	Shuyao Zhou	3	Do not know if /booklists will be a good place, but the rule on book lists is quoted below with the pertinent section bolded for you. [quote]
971	Shuyao Zhou	1	Love reading with my puppers cuddled up close. Super cozy!
972	Shuyao Zhou	3	Lots of combinations are possible. Usually a solid unlimited server on one backbone and a block on another backbone is good enough. Or 2 unlimited servers on different backbones. Speed should always be as fast as the server allows for (unlike torrents) however that fluctuates sometimes depending on your server and what you are downloading (age usually). You will need a good indexer as well but there are many that are free for limited downloads per day. Maybe try out the free ones and then decide which one you like best/want to pay for.
973	Shuyao Zhou	1	downvote this comment if the meme sucks. upvote it and I'll go away.
974	Shuyao Zhou	3	Bakhtin is pretty much the founder of modern literary criticism so I came across him pretty early. I recommend you read a literary theory introduction (there are some pretty good ones by Terry Eagleton, which is my favourite, and Peter Barry) and check out their bibliographies. You could also lurk around /r/AskLiteraryStudies, they have threads about this all the time
975	Shuyao Zhou	1	There's a subreddit called /r/whattoreadwhen that does this for books. /r/whattolistentowhen and /r/whattowatchwhen also exist, but are both dead, I'm not aware of any live versions.
976	Shuyao Zhou	1	She definitely suffers from some kind of mentall illness. Remember she made that bizarre cameo in the Scientology movie???
977	Shuyao Zhou	1	Maybe Karen shouldn't butt into the mutterings of a private conversation. No one was at risk of being beaten and/ostracized. Karen....While I understand you being offended, BITCH the world doesn't revolve around you. Find a goddamn bookclub Busy Body Betty.
978	Shuyao Zhou	1	Love it! I rarely see it on booklists, though and I don't know why. It's such a great book!
979	Shuyao Zhou	2	I think this would be a great one to read with the bookclub - lots to analyse!
980	Shuyao Zhou	1	Mine is **Inferno: A Memoir of Motherhood and Madness** by **Catherine Cho**.I added this 2 days ago to my tbr list and I can't remember where I got that from, I'm seriously getting old...In general, I follow the subs you listed as well. I love how r/52book fills my reddit with beautiful book covers. I like r/booksuggestions and r/suggestmeabook as well. I also shamelessly steal books from my goodreads friends or even their friends when they pop up in my feed. Sometimes I get books for my tbr from instagram but I don't use it that much.
981	Shuyao Zhou	3	I'm sorry, but as our [rules](/r/books/wiki/rules) state, we do not allow recommendation threads. Please refamiliarize yourself with our rules before posting.Our [Weekly Recommendation Thread][link] is always at the top of any /r/books page, and /r/booksuggestions and /r/whattoreadwhen exist as well.If you ever need help remembering a particular book, try /r/whatsthatbook or /r/tipofmytongue.Thanks.

983	Shuyao Zhou	2	On the ontological nature of fiction, you may want to have a look at the answers to [this post from a few months back][link] - in particular u/spolia_opima 's reply, which is full of up-to-date goodies. And I second u/Dyingdyingdeath on Ryan - [her website][link] even has convenient pdfs and links.

985	Shuyao Zhou	3	You’re welcome. You’ll probably get more welcomed engagement on r/books, r/suggestmeabook, r/whattoreadwhen, or r/booksuggestions.
986	Shuyao Zhou	2	I've read 19 books in 2022, or two books per week. Those books average 278 pages, so although there are a couple over 500 pages, they're balanced out by shorter books. Some are re-reads, which generally go more quickly. Here's the actual timing: On Sundays, my wife and I each pick a book, sit on the couch, and read, finishing the book that day (with one exception when I was busy). Then I find time during the rest of the week - a few minutes here, an hour there, it all adds up - and read something else. Sometimes one book, sometimes two, sometimes none.But the real "how" is that I remind myself that while watching TV is easier, and picking up my phone for a few minutes (which often stretch to hours) of Reddit, news, social media, etc. is easier, reading books is more pleasurable and gives me more satisfaction, and I make a point of doing it. I'm also active on r/52book, where I've set a goal and hold myself accountable through weekly check-ins on my progress. The goal isn't important, the number doesn't matter, and I don't force myself to hit an artificial target. But if I fall behind it's a reminder that there's something I should be doing that I enjoy and value more than other time-killers.
987	Shuyao Zhou	2	Literally no one gives a shit about booklists, what you’re complaining about is ideological difference. “Turning people away from our movement” in reality should read “People who are actively antithetical to our movement.” The ideological difference is that many conservatives believe in free markets, regressive social policies that reinscribe existing power structures, and controlling the bodies of women to maintain economic difference. There are longer discussions to be had about the rise of conservative populism, usually at the expense of working class folks of color, and/or the support of a police state that disproportionally incarcerated black folks, and to what degree conservatives back these policies in a shifting landscape, but for the last forty years and more, and in the rise of Trump, it’s been pretty overt.
988	Shuyao Zhou	1	unfortunately i'm reading  another book now but there is some subreddits such as /r/bookdiscussion and /r/books if you didn't find anyone to read your book with. discuss and write in Arabic so we can find other arab readers ;)
989	Shuyao Zhou	1	Nice!  Love holdmybeer.I posted this on the mntrolls reddit but reposting here incase it's helpful, list of mumsnet subjects and nearish reddit equivalents  (not completed!)

990	Shuyao Zhou	1	You deny it Did I? I said I didn't believe you. That's not the same thing.Instead of acknowledging your error you just move on to a new attack lineWhat exactly do you want me to acknowledge about a typo? It's meaningless. Which is why it's rather telling this is all you've bothered substantiating.extend the same basic courtesies of discussionI prove my points. I don't lie. I don't give you the run around (oh, but wait, you're going to complain that saying "start" isn't a specific reference to the start of the conversation and therefore you are completely right to be confused about what goalposts you're being accused on moving... except, no, it is a specific reference; this is precisely what I mean... here's a question I say I've answered but which I can easily quote you as saying I haven't answered).Elsewhere you've told me that it's my fault that you are being rude and aggressive toward me which is well, wow. Given you tried to gaslight me into believing I "came in hot"... yes, it is.Yes. "Literature" means written texts.But, sure, you win the point. Have a biscuit. Completely beside anything of substance, just like everything else you actually care to talk about, but you got me.
991	Shuyao Zhou	1	Thats great - sounds like  you should check out r/52book if you haven't already! People challenge themselves to read 52 books in a year (you can set any goal though).
992	Shuyao Zhou	1	Love the 52book sub for that reason. And my tbr grows steadily, but next up on it is The Master - a book about Roger Federer. I'm a tennis player and this was my Christmas gift :D
993	Shuyao Zhou	2	There are other subreddits more dedicated to discovering books - /r/suggestmeabook and /r/booksuggestions are very directly that, but /r/currentlyreading, /r/52books, /r/whattoreadwhen, /r/firstpage and just plain old /r/books are also possibilities. I don't think this sub needs to fill that niche also.
994	Shuyao Zhou	1	The one bloody year I am on top of having school booklists sorted…

996	Shuyao Zhou	2	I love multigenerational family sagas, one of my all time favourites is The House of Spirits. ( I’m reading Pachinko atm, completely missed the timing of the r/bookclub even though I was so excited to join in). Read One Hundred few years ago and wanted to re-read with the classics, but Feb was interrupted by holidays and then by sickness so sadly missed all the club reads.
997	Shuyao Zhou	1	The Postmistress of PARIS.
998	Shuyao Zhou	1	During Covid, I found r/52book and started the 1 book per week challenge. I read 65 books in 2020, but then only 52 books in 2021. This is up from 8(!) in 2019. I’m setting the same 52 book goal this year as it seems to work well for me. Unfortunately, my TBR is over 100 books long 😆
999	Shuyao Zhou	1	Ayy, 15f (almost 16, very excited for driving to be a thing.) and I also work. only twice a week though.
500	Mingyuan Ma	3	Please post recommendation requests in /r/suggestmeabook or the weekly thread. You might also like /r/askliterarystudies.
501	Mingyuan Ma	1	Thanks for the Elton update! :) 
502	Mingyuan Ma	1	I cannot really answer your question which though I think is very interesting I wouldn't dare give my uninformed opinion about. I would recommend trying r/AskLiteraryStudies, they can probably provide you with tons of opinions, theories, academic papers maybe, tips on how to proceed etc. Best of luck!
503	Mingyuan Ma	1	Won't get any newreaders on that sub, and a huge part of the fun of rewatchs/reads is seeing first timers reactions
504	Mingyuan Ma	3	Some months back I asked this community for recommended reading on the comics medium (which I naively referred to as "graphic novel" medium at the time, which is apparently distasteful nowadays). I got [a lot of really great answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/kqf1sn/recommended_reading_on_the_graphic_novel_medium/)—I wonder if any of those comments will be helpful to you?
505	Mingyuan Ma	1	Same. I saw a lot of posts in the r/52book sub of people standing next to the stack of books that they read in 2021. I can’t believe so many keep all their books!

507	Mingyuan Ma	3	 Marion and Shiva Stone are twin brothers born of a secret union between a beautiful Indian nun and a brash British surgeon at a mission hospital in Addis Ababa. Orphaned by their mother’s death in childbirth and their father’s disappearance, bound together by a preternatural connection and a shared fascination with medicine, the twins come of age as Ethiopia hovers on the brink of revolution. Yet it will be love, not politics—their passion for the same woman—that will tear them apart and force Marion, fresh out of medical school, to flee his homeland. He makes his way to America, finding refuge in his work as an intern at an underfunded, overcrowded New York City hospital. When the past catches up to him—nearly destroying him—Marion must entrust his life to the two men he thought he trusted least in the world: the surgeon father who abandoned him and the brother who betrayed him.
508	Mingyuan Ma	1	I love good histI love good history stories when it comes to nonfiction for the most part, and if it's the right author it reads like fiction almost with the added layer of true story to it. I read nonfiction to learn and fiction to enjoy or stimulate my imagination. I've also been listening to audio books on hikes, in the car, or doing chores which gives me more chances to fill me head! Definitely, I think Goodreads is just what I needed.That's probably a healthy balance of gaming, honestly. I appreciate the fact you tend to commit to one game at a time and finish it; I could be a lot better with that, especially with TV shows. At least once you make the decision you follow through with it! 😅 I've heard some good things about Ori, and the art looked really nice for it!Wow that's a hard question, now that I think about it! Sorry to put you on the spot like that. If I'm being honest, I'd probably have to say Minecraft was my favorite indie game I've ever played. It's massive now, but when my friends and I all bought it, it was only sort of recently into beta and wasn't owned by Microsoft yet. Some of my friends had started playing it in alpha even. We were fresh into high school, so no cars yet, and we put a ton of hours into like 2 servers over the course of 2 years. The fact that I was hanging out with my friends and the game was regularly being updated to add new things for us to do and explore and building massive projects together late into the night are memories I'm pretty fond of. Minecraft was a really fun gaming experience that I don't think will ever truly be replicated for me in adulthood. I would say, in general, PC gaming in high school with my friends amounted to my favorite times on video games - we would sometimes cop random cheap games on Steam sales too, and we played a lot of Team Fortress 2 and Payday 2. One of my top gaming experiences happened in Skyrim though, and playing through Shadow of the Colossus (which I can't recommend enough) on PS2 was an incredible single player experience!Well anyways, I could go on, but I don't want to take up all your time lol. It's been a real pleasure talking with you, and thank you so much for your suggestions on booklists and Goodreads! I will definitely get some use out of it. And sorry for the delayed response, I've been busy and off Reddit for a bit!ory stories when it comes to nonfiction for the most part, and if it's the right author it reads like fiction almost with the added layer of true story to it. I read nonfiction to learn and fiction to enjoy or stimulate my imagination. I've also been listening to audio books on hikes, in the car, or doing chores which gives me more chances to fill me head! Definitely, I think Goodreads is just what I needed.That's probably a healthy balance of gaming, honestly. I appreciate the fact you tend to commit to one game at a time and finish it; I could be a lot better with that, especially with TV shows. At least once you make the decision you follow through with it! 😅 I've heard some good things about Ori, and the art looked really nice for it!Wow that's a hard question, now that I think about it! Sorry to put you on the spot like that. If I'm being honest, I'd probably have to say Minecraft was my favorite indie game I've ever played. It's massive now, but when my friends and I all bought it, it was only sort of recently into beta and wasn't owned by Microsoft yet. Some of my friends had started playing it in alpha even. We were fresh into high school, so no cars yet, and we put a ton of hours into like 2 servers over the course of 2 years. The fact that I was hanging out with my friends and the game was regularly being updated to add new things for us to do and explore and building massive projects together late into the night are memories I'm pretty fond of.

509	Mingyuan Ma	1	Imagine my surprise when (haven't completed the story yet, so most enemies don't go above 6) I was doing the bookclub quests and got to the part where you get ambushed. Had my bow out since I wasn't expecting it. Lvl 9 renegades, one boss one with a 2 hander. I have all inhibs with max stam and rest in HP. 2hits later I was dead. Yet he tanks 10 hits from my almost 450dmg electro sword. God bless chain electricity stuns though, cause fighting him in that tiny room was slightly difficult.
510	Mingyuan Ma	3	[link] Anna Petrovna Kern name after second marriage: Markova-Vinogradskaya was a Russian socialite and memoirist, best known as the addressee of what is probably the best known love poem in the Russian language, written by Aleksandr Pushkin in 1825. Anna was born in Oryol at the mansion of her grandfather, the local governor. She was brought up in Lubny in the Poltava Governorate (present-day Ukraine). On 8 January 1817 she was married by her parents to the 56-year-old General Kern, whom she professed to detest thoroughly.
511	Mingyuan Ma	2	Every month I try and just pick what I feel like reading \*within\* these categories -   1-2 books for my Reading Around the World Challenge1 book for my bookclub1 classic I haven't read1 light and easy romcom type book1 Literary fiction1 from a series I'm reading  After that I just read whatever suits me until the new month.
512	Mingyuan Ma	2	She sounds generous. The best. Maybe she needs to come join bookclub one of these days
513	Mingyuan Ma	1	Probably better off going to r/suggestmeabook or r/whattoreadwhen.
514	Mingyuan Ma	3	Whether we are dealing with a rude clerk, our child saying, "That's not fair!," our spouse ignoring us, or an uncooperative co-worker, in our struggle to respond effectively, we often become defensive - sometimes without even realizing it. Despite good intentions, we can become manipulative and controlling, even with those we love most. 
515	Mingyuan Ma	3	After a nuclear World War III has destroyed most of the globe, the few remaining survivors in southern Australia await the radioactive cloud that is heading their way and bringing certain death to everyone in its path. Among them is an American submarine captain struggling to resist the knowledge that his wife and children in the United States must be dead. Then a faint Morse code signal is picked up, transmitting from somewhere near Seattle, and Captain Towers must lead his submarine crew on a bleak tour of the ruined world in a desperate search for signs of life. On the Beach is a remarkably convincing portrait of how ordinary people might face the most unimaginable nightmare.
516	Mingyuan Ma	1	Always happy to hear more people chime in! I know a big thing for all the contributors is knowing that people are actually reading and using posts/booklists/work. A little thank you goes a long way!Always happy to hear suggestions to. *Generally* we try to keep the bulk of recommendations from flaired members because it gives us a good idea of who's expertise is suggesting it. Not *super* sure what other avenues for volunteer work there is, other then as your using it let us know if you come across any problems. Broken links, typos, stuff like that.
517	Mingyuan Ma	1	If you're unfamiliar with Zen Pencils [link], I strongly recommend reading more about those comics and their background - [link]There is a lot of good material on there.
518	Mingyuan Ma	1	My last post: [link]The last two books were:* House of Hades, by Rick Riordan.* All Quiet on the Western Front, by Enrich Maria Remarque. The last book was absolutely disheartening, and I loved it!
519	Mingyuan Ma	3	*You know what writers esteem by knowing about writers and finding out what influenced them most.* There's no reason people esteem most what they've been influenced by. You can take ideas and methods from a book all while thinking that the use of those ideas and methods ultimately don't add up to much in the original book. *How many books have been written about Ulysses, Bleak House, Tristram Shandy? Lots.* It's not necessarily writers writing these books about Ulysses etc.? It's scholars of these books or their period, which is a distinctly different group, writing about these authors for perhaps entirely different reasons; *How many writers clearly take influences from those novels and talk about them in interviews or things that they write?* But again, influence is more a matter of the potential of some idea or thing author A did to being used by author B; author A may have achieved something brilliant except his ideas and methods are not transferable to most other kinds of books, or he may have use a brilliant idea or technique abysmally poorly in a similarly poor book, and that idea or technique gets used widely and influences legions of writers.
520	Mingyuan Ma	1	They're probably gunna remove your post per the rules in the side bar, so try the weekly suggestion thread or any of these related subs where you might find recommendations ([from my great big list of book realted subs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnZz_HTCD_pNdEw4cGdjODhkUGQ0REpXSERXa2ZjSlE&amp;usp=sharing)):
521	Mingyuan Ma	3	I use a books multi, so I've got a lot of less active subs on it. Apart from audiobook subs, free ebook subs, and ones already mentioned, here are the rest of my (relatively inactive) book subs:/r/bookdiscussion/r/booktomovie/r/epicpoems/r/literature/r/mythsandlegends/r/neilgaiman/r/robolit/r/truebooks/r/weirdlit/r/wodehouse
522	Mingyuan Ma	2	I love "Julián is a Mermaid" and "Julián at the Wedding" by Jessica Love, as well as "My Shadow Is Pink" by Scott Stuart. The author who wrote "Ada Twist, Scientist!" has also written lots of books that aren't explicitly about gender, but they feature children defying gender norms and exercising their independence and talents.Social Justice Books also has some really great book lists that cover lots of different topics. Here's their list of recommended books pertaining to Gender Identity: [link]
523	Mingyuan Ma	2	This really isnt kindle related. Likely have better luck with:/r/books /r/bookdiscussion /r/readalong
524	Mingyuan Ma	2	I'm not sure if such a website or program exists and - as a literary scholar by training - I am somewhat skeptical that such an approach would do a good job at teaching the necessary skills to critically engage with literature. I could very much see it run the risk of  boiling literary analysis down to nothing but a checklist of actionable steps and removing any kind of ambiguities (and thus potential) from literary texts.While there are certain protocols to follow in literary studies, the craft is much more free form than, say, running a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, it is a matter of being receptive to the nuances of a text - and to bring one's understanding of (literary) theory and history into dialogue with these nuances. (I am, of course, oversimplifying.)Thus, building a personal repertoire of literary theories and a solid understanding of (literary) histories might be one of the best bets to become better at critically engaging with literature. Building this repertoire, in turn, is probably best achieved through reading - and discussing what one has read.When it comes to the former, you can find a few recommendations in the following:If you want to dip your toes into some pop-literary studies first, you might want to try something like Thomas C. Foster's *How to Read Literature Like A Prof*, which u/pm_me_poemsplease recommended in a similar context.Another great way to get a first feel for almost any academic field are Oxford University Press's Very Short Introductions - in this case Jonathan Culler's Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction.You could also have a look at general introductory textbooks, like Mario Klarer's *An Introduction to Literary Studies,* or at textbooks focusing specifically on literary theory, such as erry Eagleton's *Literary Theory: An Introduction* and Peter Barry's *Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory*. In case you would prefer to watch a lecture on the topic, there is always [Yale's Open Course on Literary Theory](https://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300).Finally, if you want to dive straight into the deep end, you could have a look at Cambridge University Press's extensive list of *Cambridge Companions to X* and *Cambridge Histories of Y*, where X and Y are something like "the Victorian novel" and "American Literature."I hope some of this helps and I am sorry I couldn't offer any more open-source resources.If you've got any questions, feel free to ask!EDIT: You might also want to check out r/AskLiteraryStudies. :)
525	Mingyuan Ma	1	My slump was 2020. The pandemic and losing my job because of it.  The isolation.  Should have been reading more but read way less.  /r/52book got me out of my slump.  Just having that goal with other people.  Honestly it’s my favorite sub of all.  Love seeing what everyone is reading and random recommendations.  With no expectations on goals, you don’t have to read 52 or start at any specific time. 
526	Mingyuan Ma	2	Next level reminds me of extreme movie.
527	Mingyuan Ma	2	No shame in your goal. Everyone is different.I also enjoy my own internal monologue, while reading, and it slows me down. So, I completely understand. Sometimes, my internal monologue helps me understand the book, even more.I look forward to seeing more of you.Side note, this would be more appropriate for the [current annual  Introduction thread.][link]
528	Mingyuan Ma	3	Like they are lacking empathy? So the society of Omelas is contingent upon the unhappiness of one person, and the ones who don't walk away from Omelas lack empathy for the one child that has to suffer.It sounds like alienation, in a broad sense, which is taken up by many authors differently. Marx identifies four varieties of alienation under capitalism, one of which is alienation from other people. For Marx the concept of alienation from your fellow "man", and/or a conception called the species-being, is going to hinge dramatically upon how people relate to each other, and how people relate to commodities under capitalism.For other authors, the concept of alienation shows up with relation to Alienation of people from each other regarding the subject of race and race relations; men from women on the basis of perceived differences along genders, and so on. You might get a better, and more precise answer, from r/askliterarystudies as there are a lot of works interpreting Le Guin literarily. However one video discussion I think is somewhat relevant, is this one from Jeremy Rifkin. He suggests that utopia lacks empathy, and that empathy is anti utopian. Since you're asking about a classic utopian fiction with I think this is a reasonable way to go.  
529	Mingyuan Ma	2	May have better luck in a recommendation based subreddit:
530	Mingyuan Ma	1	Read 52 books this year!  Try to read 1 non fiction a month and 1 classic a month.  r/52book
531	Mingyuan Ma	3	r/suggestmeabookr/EliversusMonsterCityr/booksuggestionsr/52bookr/joeledger
532	Mingyuan Ma	1	Tordotcom specializes in more literary/envelope-pushing sff than some of the other publishing imprints (compare Baen, for instance). From my experience making coming-soon lists and such, women, nb authors, and men of color are more active in writing this type of fantasy, whereas a lot of the big names writing sff that are white guys often operate in more "traditional" SFF. Generalizations, of course, but I think it's worth noting.
533	Mingyuan Ma	3	Sabrina the Teenage Witch is a comic book series published by Archie Comics about the adventures of a fictional American teenager named Sabrina Spellman. Sabrina was created by writer George Gladir and artist Dan DeCarlo, and first appeared in Archie's Madhouse #22 (cover-dated Oct. 1962). Storylines of the character at elementary-school-age also appear under the title "Sabrina -- That Cute Little Witch" in almost all of the Little Archie comics.
534	Mingyuan Ma	1	Welcome to r/bookclub. Glaf to have you on board for Wuthering Heights :)
535	Mingyuan Ma	2	The people who do hermeneutics might have a word for it, but I think you're probably better off trying /r/AskLiteraryStudies, this seems more up their alley.
536	Mingyuan Ma	2	I think some of the heavy hitters in r/52book balance out the nonreaders.
537	Mingyuan Ma	2	I naturally gravitate toward female protagonist type stories but am actively looking to expand into other genres and am finding they are equally if not more engaging. I might even try to pare down my amount of nonfiction reading if I can find enough enthralling nonfiction. I’ve been combing through npr booklists and it seems to help with this.
538	Mingyuan Ma	2	You remind me of the movie "Intermission" from 2003
539	Mingyuan Ma	3	These surveys were done only two years after circumcision. Both tacked on to the end of an HIV study. So the people were pressured into getting a circumcision for HIV benefits and then asked if there was a detriment. Surely you see the conflict of:1) Being pressured to undergo a procedure for health benefits, and *then* being asked if there’s downsides.2) These are 5 point surveys, a pretty terrible way to note the complexity and nuances of sexual pleasure.3) With a language barrier to boot.4) The skin and glans were protected for 20+ years, and then exposed for only up to 2 years. Leading to,5) Applying data from adult circumcisions to newborn circumcisions is overextending the data. That’s two years and one year of glans and foreskin remnant exposure compared to ~16-18 years for newborn circumcision before their sex life *starts*.
540	Mingyuan Ma	2	This is my favorite book list: [link]
541	Mingyuan Ma	2	What really helped for me personally was finding some social obligations to get reading again by joining a bookclub with a bunch of friends. Of course it may not be for everybody but it really helped me.
542	Mingyuan Ma	3	A branch for the 18th century might be the Age of the Novel/Rise of the Novel. Also rather than Age of Pope I would consider it more appropriately described as the Age of Satire. Early C18 is also usually referred to as the Enlightenment Period rather than Classical/Augustan.Also, r/askliterarystudies would probably be a useful resource for this project.
543	Mingyuan Ma	2	Making jewelry, painting, listening to podcasts, audiobooks as well, adult coloring books, hiking, paddleboarding, board games, roadtrips, dinner parties, music( EDM to Indie to 80s rock)
544	Mingyuan Ma	1	Here's a sneak peek of /r/bookclub using the [top posts][link] of the year!
545	Mingyuan Ma	1	Memoirs of the Twentieth Century is an early work of speculative fiction by Irish writer Samuel Madden. This 1733 epistolary novel takes the form of a series of diplomatic letters written in 1997 and 1998. The work is a satire perhaps modeled after Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels published seven years before. Madden was an Anglican clergyman, and the book is focused on the dangers of Catholicism and Jesuits, depicting a future where they dominate.
546	Mingyuan Ma	3	There's no one sub for all, but plenty of subject-specific ones:    r/Ijustwatched   r/iwatchedanoldmovie r/IWatchedAnOldSeries r/books
547	Mingyuan Ma	2	I wrote this in r/books, i don't know why now it is in r/suggestmeabook
548	Mingyuan Ma	1	Joining r/52book helped me.  2020 was bad and even though I was unemployed I didn’t really read.  Then in 2021 joining 52 book and having a goal, seeing what other people were reading and suggesting lit a fire and I got to 52 last year.  Hope you join us.  One fave I recommend to everyone - Project Hail Mary.  It’s amaze!!
549	Mingyuan Ma	3	These are all of the ones I had on my multi that weren't on your list:* /r/52book* /r/audiobooks [link]
550	Mingyuan Ma	2	That's the beauty of the bookclub, they join, he tells them what it says and why that makes liberals bad, and then they can claim to have read it without having to read. It's the perfect system.
551	Mingyuan Ma	1	You just brought back some horrible memories from that Vaastu shaastra movie. Was that the movie? The one where a hand keeps coming out from the ground? Fucking creepy.
552	Mingyuan Ma	1	What / bookclub?
553	Mingyuan Ma	2	To be fair, the only poets he thinks are good are ["Homer, Virgil, Dante, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Goethe and maybe Dickinson"][link], so it's a pretty high bar (especially since you assume he must have read them in their original languages to make such a pronouncement). [He's also 19][link], so there is still a little hope that he'll grow out of it.
554	Mingyuan Ma	1	As for alternatives, I don't go here much because I find this sub grating (for reasons that have nothing to do with the moderation), and like, there are SO MANY alternatives out there already. There's /r/writers, /r/PubTips, r/publishing, /r/storyandstyle, /r/YAwriters, /r/fantasywriters, /r/FanFiction, and that's just the writing subs I can keep up with. /r/BetaReaders and /r/DestructiveReaders have occasional craft threads. Tons of reading-focused subs - /r/Fantasy, /r/literature, /r/TrueLit, /r/horrorlit - have a community of writers and regular writing discussion in weekly threads, regular threads, or even dedicated threads. There really isn't a dearth of writing content on this site. Really. I would say there's writing content for any level and any preference. I would frankly feel silly complaining.
555	Mingyuan Ma	3	Please explain in strictly medical terms why this is happening to me: [link].
556	Mingyuan Ma	2	/r/BookDiscussion is a little quiet but does exist.
557	Mingyuan Ma	2	m just trying to save this community from the vexatious experience of reading "Master and Margarita". What a load of hogwash. r/AskLiteraryStudies, you've been warned.
558	Mingyuan Ma	2	the posts keeps getting deleted there so just wanted to post in some popular book sub. and r/bookdiscussion is too small. I'll delete it after some time
559	Mingyuan Ma	1	I fuckin swear ask literary studies is the newest argbuks.
560	Mingyuan Ma	2	[I definitely am][link]😅
561	Mingyuan Ma	1	Agreed the first few chapters were slow but now i am super invested in the David, Charles, Edward triangle. Be sure to tell us what you thought on the [first check-in][link] especially if you will zip off without us ;)
562	Mingyuan Ma	1	Hey there, I'd recommend also asking this question in r/AskLiteraryStudies as Pop Culture is an established area of study within the discipline and has been so for some time now.
563	Mingyuan Ma	1	Nice! What are you reading?  Are you subbed to /r/52book ?
564	Mingyuan Ma	1	An X-Men movie?
565	Mingyuan Ma	3	What unites such diverse academic fields as music composition, theory, musicology, cognition, literary studies, neuropsychology, economics, anatomy, genetics, bioinformatics, political science, geopolitics, pharmacology and anthropology? A terminological non-issue that respondents have been telling you for three years is easily resolved by opening a dictionary.
566	Mingyuan Ma	1	Hmm, 518 subscriptions, no wonder I never see most of these on the front page.
567	Mingyuan Ma	1	Great, Rupert's going to stop his newreaders from talking and stop publishing his birdcage liners.
568	Mingyuan Ma	1	You probably want /r/askliterarystudies because ain't none of this stuff in the Bible
569	Mingyuan Ma	2	Charlotte Mason inspired curricula are classical; Ambleside Online is a completely free option with booklists and guides for a secular Charlotte Mason-style curriculum. It’s a lot of work on the parents’ end to gather all the books and set everything up, but it’s a great education model that encourages reading and critical thinking. It’s definitely not just a pile of workbooks to hand the kid to go through, but the prep is worth it. We love it.
570	Mingyuan Ma	1	There’s r/52book I spend most of my time over there lol I’m not aware of any prompts they have? Cause like the point/goal is to read a book a week. Some people pair 52 book challenge with an A-Z challenge or the PopSugar challenge. Never heard of it is a club. Usually just a challenge or that subreddit
571	Mingyuan Ma	2	Oh nice idea. I found this thread: [link]So i think i’ll join through there
572	Mingyuan Ma	1	For your readers advisory do you just stay up to date on booklists? I don't do it at all in my special library but sometimes when I sub in public I want to still be able to suggest some good stuff.
573	Mingyuan Ma	2	This would be a better post in /r/Criticaltheory or /r/Askliterarystudies than here to be honest.
574	Mingyuan Ma	1	It's like r/52book, but for quilts!
575	Mingyuan Ma	2	You might get more discussion at r/books or r/bookdiscussion
576	Mingyuan Ma	1	Wait, just so I'm understanding correctly, you're unhappy with /r/literature? May I inquire as to why?But back to your request (warning, I'm ,not subscribed to any of these, I just know about them and am assuming that you are seeking discussion) you might check out **/r/bookclub**. They also have niche clubs if your are feeling particularly...niche-y (y'know?). /r/SF_Book_Club  /r/Fantasy_Bookclub  /r/scifi_bookclub  /r/playclub  /r/science_bookclub  /r/nonfiction_bookclub  /r/history_bookclub  /r/KindleBookClubThere's /r/bookdiscussion, but the last post was four months ago. There's also /r/booksandtea which is very small but has the possibility to become active. I don't know... Maybe we need... A *new* one. A *true* one...
577	Mingyuan Ma	2	if you check out /r/52book you will see a dedicated few who break 100+ books in a single year.  With people who dedicate that much time to reading it definitely helps bring the average up.
578	Mingyuan Ma	1	Why do none of you guys buy books from your booklists 🙁
579	Mingyuan Ma	3	To Have or to Be? is a 1976 book by psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, in which he differentiates between having and being. It was originally published in the World Perspectives book series edited by Ruth Nanda Anshen for Harper &amp; Row publishing firm. Fromm writes that modern society has become materialistic and prefers "having" to "being". 
580	Mingyuan Ma	1	2021 was the year I tried audiobooks for the first time. But I just needed to have the physical copies too. It's a bad habit I'm trying to overcome. I have had some REALLY good reads this year. I rated them in tiers. (I regret putting the book "Shout" in good and not great) I hope this answers your question.
581	Mingyuan Ma	1	The fact that so many are replying to me unironically with the take that "leftists need to stop making problematic jokes that give the right ammunition" ummm you know what gives the right WAY MORE ammunition??? Wokescolds. Have fun trying to build a strong left when it's just a very small bookclub where no one can make jokes. How the fuck have we already forgotten the gamergate era??
582	Mingyuan Ma	3	**[Germinal (novel)][link]Germinal is the thirteenth novel in Émile Zola's twenty-volume series Les Rougon-Macquart. Often considered Zola's masterpiece and one of the most significant novels in the French tradition, the novel – an uncompromisingly harsh and realistic story of a coalminers' strike in northern France in the 1860s – has been published and translated in over one hundred countries and has additionally inspired five film adaptations and two television productions. Germinal was written between April 1884 and January 1885. It was first serialized between November 1884 and February 1885 in the periodical Gil Blas, then in March 1885 published as a book.

586	Mingyuan Ma	1	Happy Cake Day 🍰I'm reading a about Modernism and Google came up with this [this][link] from 7 years ago. Thanks kind stranger for the info.
587	Mingyuan Ma	1	Here's a sneak peek of /r/bookdiscussion using the [top posts][link] of the year!
588	Mingyuan Ma	1	My bookclub is currently reading it!
589	Mingyuan Ma	2	{{The Power}} by Naomi Alderman. Read it in my bookclub and it generated a decent discussion.  Not an exact fit for superheroes but more along the lines of gaining superpowers
590	Mingyuan Ma	1	Another reason to ditch spiro for me is to reduce the amount of pills I’m popping for liver/kidney health, and to be able to afford an ADHD prescription on top of hrt.
591	Mingyuan Ma	1	AFAIK UK and European PhD applicants typically already have a masters level degree in the field, and you'll be expected to have a thesis project basically ready to go, and you should really have a specific faculty member in mind to work with.
592	Mingyuan Ma	3	This probably lies under book lists and recommendations which aren’t allowed outside the sticky’d weekly topics. r/booksuggestions, r/suggestmeabook, and r/whattoreadwhen is more welcoming to these sorts of threads.
593	Mingyuan Ma	2	This comes up a lot but it is a difficult thing to Google. Here's some previous discussion: [link]Basically it's a realism thing; it keeps up the conceit that the novel tells of real events, by implying there's been some anonymization.
594	Mingyuan Ma	1	I wish you luck on your reading journey!  My approach to the Horus Heresy has been piecemeal at best; I tend to just pick up whichever looks interesting, or whatever is included in the latest Humble Bundle.  I also have a notebook dedicated to keeping track of booklists like the one above!
595	Mingyuan Ma	2	I started my law course in semester 2 after transferring from Griffith University.First, the second semester of the 2022 academic year commences July 18, with semester one beginning, at least for me as a third year, on March 3, so you have plenty of time to sort out any administrative issues with QUT. Booklists: you'll get your booklist for your respective courses when you enrol and then register into your classes. So, until then, don't stress about booklists.ID card: this is fairly simple. If I recall correctly, I simply uploaded a photo to my profile in the student portal (I think it's formally called eStudent?) and requested a student ID card with that photograph on it. Do you have you QUT log in credentials to access HiQ, eStudent, and Blackboard? I've never actually had to use my ID card once outside of examinations (which for you will be from Novermber 5-19) and late access to the law library. Generally though, I would advise you contact HiQ on the numbers provided through this link: [https://www.qut.edu.au/about/contact](https://www.qut.edu.au/about/contact)Hope this helps :)
596	Mingyuan Ma	3	It looks like you're trying to start a conversation, but you haven't included much for users to respond to.

598	Mingyuan Ma	1	Congrats on the job BB!! ✨It’s okay, life happens. Thank you for letting us enjoy your talents and bookclub during this time. No pressure for anything; we will be existing in the abyss🖤💙Drink your water, try not to stress, you’ll do amazing out in the world ☺️
599	Mingyuan Ma	2	My great hope is that this obnoxious language shit will settle down as society becomes more open and stops terrorizing the queer community. I also think we’ll settle on more pleasant and natural expressions on over time. I’m very pleased with “they” as a gender neutral, way better than all the others.
600	Mingyuan Ma	2	Their friends are the bookclub.
601	Mingyuan Ma	3	I'm trying to connect up the various parts of your wide-ranging concerns. I recognise your outline of the various "schools", but I'm wondering how "human value" and its redefinition fits into that. Are you asking whether accessibility and utility have become a) "human values" (in a humanist sense?), b) "human *and thereby* literary values", c) "human *and thereby* aesthetic values" (differs from the previous in that what critics value in literature is not necessarily the aesthetic, however defined), d) some other combination of these/other concepts?In any case, I think the concepts of accessibility and utility for someone like Jameson must always be historicised: accessible and useful *for whom, at what time, in what kind of society*, etc. To my ear, accessibility has the ring of a kind of democratisation as an ideal with liberal overtones, and almost opposed to the modernist project. I would indeed be interested to see how you might connect the accessibility of literature to an emancipatory politics. I am reminded (as I often am!) of Jameson's article, "Reification and utopia in mass culture", which posits that popular media (his references are *Jaws* and the *Godfather* movies) are popular because they contain an emancipatory core, however transformed or even perverted it may have become. Perhaps what you can ask is how the emancipatory core can/needs to be transformed precisely because it needs to become accessible?
602	Mingyuan Ma	2	I say "podcasts", but I'm mostly listening to Great Courses lectures with regards to analysis of the source material and pop-culture podcasts with regards to the film. See [other comment][link]
603	Mingyuan Ma	1	i do a lot of reading related stuff, mostly /r/Fantasy r/books (the weekly threads only) /r/52book /r/suggestmeabook and /r/YAlit  /r/kpop lol /r/HobbyDrama and /r/iamveryculinary
604	Mingyuan Ma	1	Well God bless Oprah. I hope she has a long and fulfilling life. She surely made the world great with her booklists and interviews. God bless her
605	Mingyuan Ma	1	Great! Thanks for clarifying! It's getting a bit late, so I won't go into too much detail. If anything thus ends up reading too jargon-y, feel free to follow up!Depending on your focus, you will probably end up with the skills of a data scientist and digital consultant on the one hand - or those of an ethics consultant or policy adviser on the other. (Ideally both!)
606	Mingyuan Ma	3	Internet Invention is a book by Gregory Ulmer. The book describes Ulmer's definition of "electracy" (as opposed to orality or literacy) and leads readers through activities that ask them to examine their interactions with four discourses, which Ulmer labels career, family, entertainment, and community.
607	Mingyuan Ma	1	The bookclub. There's 10 of them I think? You gotta sleep a few times in-between a few to get the next. So have fun making that run 10x lmao. I did em all in a row and it was draining... Idk if it's an unmarked quest you gotta stumble upon or not.

610	Mingyuan Ma	2	 I look at:1) The daily deals section. Found some great books there.2) See what people are reading on /r/52book3) Check genre subreddits like /r/fantasy4) Look at /r/suggestmeabook5) Go to a physical book store and see what's interesting. Then buy on Kobo.
611	Mingyuan Ma	1	I'm reading **The Master and Margarita** and **Hamnet** with r/bookclub. It's taken a lot of strength to not just finish Hamnet in one sitting. It is so enjoyable. I'm also trying to wrap up **A Series of Unfortunate Events: The End** this week in honor of my daughter's birthday (I read the first 10 to her in my belly). Also reading **Cleopatra's Dagger**. I finished **The Cruel Prince** this week, trying to dip my toes into fantasy. So far so good. 
612	Mingyuan Ma	2	If you turn off subreddit style (with RES) then it's almost usable, but there's still spam in there.
613	Mingyuan Ma	1	Flaired scholars, panelists, and directed discussions could very much be hosted here and I think would be beneficial.they could... or they could be hosted on /r/AskLiteraryStudies, as they have been for many years.
614	Mingyuan Ma	3	In formal Standard English, it would be "Joe's and my," as in, "Joe's (booklist) and my booklist." This is what you would be expected to use in formal writing and on grammar tests.In informal contexts, native speakers use all sorts of other combinations, e.g., "Joe and I's," "me and Joe's," etc.Also note that if you replace the pronoun "my" with another name or noun, then the format depends on whether the booklist is shared or each person has a separate booklist:"Joe and Jill's booklist" - The booklist is shared (i.e., there's only one), so possession is marked on the second noun only."Joe's and his brother's booklists" - Each person has a separate booklist (or more than one each), so possession is marked on both nouns.But the following is also possible:"Joe and Jill's booklists" - There are multiple booklists, but they all belong to both Joe and Jill.
615	Mingyuan Ma	2	**Gil's All Fright Diner by A. Lee Martinez:** A funny, laidback supernatural/paranormal read placed in Tennessee, perfect for October.**Tales from the Gas Station, Vol. 1 by Jack Townsend:** A great combination of humor, paranormal and horror, this was greatly enjoyable. Mr Creepypasta was an excellent choice for narrating it.**We Are Never Meeting in Real Life. by Samantha Irby:** It was interesting, at times sad and at times funny, the narration by the author seemed long-winded, not my favourite.**This is Going to Hurt, Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor by Adam Kay:** NHS cases recounted in wry, british humour (and why most healthcare systems have been collapsing the last few  years completely unprepared for a crisis)
616	Mingyuan Ma	3	Your submission has been removed for the following reason(s):ELI5 is not for:Subjective or speculative replies - Only objective explanations are permitted here; your question is asking for speculation or subjective responses This would be better placed in a book subreddit like /r/AskLiteraryStudies or /r/BookDiscussion
617	Mingyuan Ma	1	Submit to /r/WhatToReadWhen , I'm sure the guys on there would appreciate it. What's your stack?
618	Mingyuan Ma	2	I mean, r/books is probably the biggest and well known. r/bookdiscussion is also out there, but it's not very big.
619	Mingyuan Ma	2	Have you read the rest of Moore's books? Because they're amazing. I'd say Lamb and Fool(and it's about to be released serpent of venice) are the most similar since they are set in the past.
620	Mingyuan Ma	3	Popular enough to be known among those who like to read. Pick any mainstream "top 100 novels" list -- e.g. [Time's Top 100 Novels of 1923-2005][link] or [Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century][link]. The vast majority of those books have been translated into Japanese.
621	Mingyuan Ma	2	I've asked reddit how you guys keep track of books [here][link]Processed the input and built a tool - a better, cleaner way (compared to something like goodreads) to keep track of your books and make recommendations to your friends / followers.Read This Twice is not new, it's been around for a bit. It's a platform where we organize \~2000 leaders' book recommendations, and now you can create your own public profile, your own public/private reading lists with notes/comments/reviews.I'd love to get some feedback from people in here if this is something you'd potentially use. You can signup and try it out at [link].P. S. There's a few different layouts, sorting, etc. to organize your books, and here's my profile for reference: [link]Thank you!
622	Mingyuan Ma	4	To them good ol days exist in pre industrial natural selection world or in some fictional novel.Worst ideologies are those that promises Utopian world. They roads leads to nowhere and are paved with blood."Nirvana is not for this world"
623	Mingyuan Ma	2	I actually just finished reading this one as part of my reading challenge this year [link] and I loved it! And yet I completely agree with you. The lesson/s in it are nothing new or overly enlightening by the time you are in your 30s if you have a modicum of self awareness
624	Mingyuan Ma	3	A snowclone is a cliché and phrasal template that can be used and recognized in multiple variants. The term was coined as a neologism in 2004, derived from journalistic clichés that referred to the number of Eskimo words for snow.
625	Mingyuan Ma	1	Hello! Happy to see you are keeping these bookclub posts going - I didn't see the last one, but I just finished a book with some unexpected ace rep so came looking to see if there were any more posts where I could share my find!
626	Mingyuan Ma	1	Probably gonna be sent over to r/booksuggestions, r/suggestmeabook, or r/whattoreadwhen. Recommendations are only allowed in the weekly thread here.
627	Mingyuan Ma	3	I chose this as one of the 2022 popsugar reading challenge books as recommended by another /r/52book member suggested and I have mixed feelings. The world and voices were rich but I wanted more? I think I’m not so fond of strange chronology (as this book works backwards in time) because every small vignette of the Garcia girls’ lives I ended up wanting to see where it went from there, instead of stepping into the past further. But the writing itself was vibrant and full of life.
628	Mingyuan Ma	3	I'm sure you can find another subreddit to meet your needs if you don't like /r/books anymore. There are tons of book related subs and you could make your own [multireddit][link]  that gives you what you want.* /r/52book* /r/audiobooks[link]
629	Mingyuan Ma	2	I know of r/AskLiteraryStudies. Not sure if that's exactly what you want.
630	Mingyuan Ma	1	More so me than my friends, and I feel bad about it sometimes. But when the weekend *finally* rolls around, I'm tired and I want to spend time with my family. I'd rather have friends over to play board games in person or watch a movie. If I game these days, it's solo. Multiplayer games just come with too much required effort and game-knowledge unless you want to be a detriment to your friends. I still have my PC and consoles. I still get excited about upcoming releases (though rarely actually play them anymore), but when it comes down to staying up late on a Friday/Saturday to play games together until the wee hours...it's just not super appealing to me anymore. And that kinda sucks, because I have some friendships that exist entirely online, primarily around gaming together, and I don't want those to be lost.
631	Mingyuan Ma	2	Right now I’m just being downvoted despite this being r/AskLiteraryStudies and not r/AskEnglishLiterature. I should’ve expected that. Even though I realize now that I forgot to say what it was actually from, though to be fair, anyone who would know the answer would also know where it was from and probably not downvote me.
632	Mingyuan Ma	2	I've also noticed that there's a moderate percentage of people who post here who don't seem very savvy with reddit/formatting/etc. - they might not be regular redditors, but they're in search of a book. I think adding extra rules would discourage some of these people from posting, which would be a shame.
633	Mingyuan Ma	3	For teen girls, there's r/feemagers which may be exactly what you're looking for.As far as books go:* r/bookdiscussion* r/suggestmeabook* r/truebooks* r/currentlyreading
634	Mingyuan Ma	3	I agree, but I do have some thoughts on this plot hole (sorry in advance for the wall of text). I think that the Order's members magic (Tonks casting "Locomotor Trunk", etc) at the Dursley's House did actually register with the Trace and the Ministry did send additional owls telling Harry he had committed further crimes. However, by the time the Ministry would have sent these owl, Harry would have left Privet Drive well before they arrived. I mean, it did take some time for the ones the Ministry sent for the Patronus charm to show up at the Dursleys house (the owls only started arriving well after Harry had carried Dudley home with Mrs. Figg, and then got into a heated argument with the Uncle Vernon). Why then did Harry not receive these letters from the owls? Well shortly after he left the Dursleys, he arrived at Number 12 Grimmauld Place. While I'm not exactly sure how a secret keeper would affect how efficiently an owl can deliver a letter to the intended receiver, I don't think the letters would have gotten to Harry. After his trial while Harry is waiting for his fifth year letter to arrive listing what textbooks he would need for the upcoming year, the letter isn't delivered to him directly. It's Ron who brings it to him: [quote]The lateness of the letters arrival may simply be because Harry, Ron and Hermione were at a location with a secret keeper and they could not be delivered properly. Regardless, if the ministry had sent letters to Harry for magic the Order members did while collecting him from the Dursleys, I do not think these letters would have reached him. They would have not been delivered, or would have gone to Dumbledore (the secret keeper) or some other Order member living there at the time.So if the ministry did actually send letters to Harry about this magic, the next question would be why didn't the ministry bring it up at his trial? I'd suspect Dumbledore would have been able to clear it up easily. When Harry first cast the patronus charm, he was told in one of the letters he received from Mr. Weasley that Dumbledore was at the ministry talking to Fudge and dealing with the situation. Eventually Dumbledore was able to get his expulsion suspended until Harry went to his Hearing. So this shows that Dumbledore was actively involved in this case. So while Harry was waiting for his trial at Grimmauld place, I think Dumbledore could have easily presented evidence to the ministry via priori incantatem to show that Tonks or whoever had casted magic when collecting Harry, getting those charges dropped.I agree with OP this is a plot hole, but I think the Ministry did detect Tonks and others magic at the Dursley's house. They likely sent a letter to Harry with additional charges but he never received it (he was at Grimmauld Place) and Dumbledore cleared the situation up before it could be brought up at Harry's trial.
635	Mingyuan Ma	3	John Perkins started and stopped writing Confessions of an Economic Hit Man four times over 20 years. He says he was threatened and bribed in an effort to kill the project, but after 9/11 he finally decided to go through with this expose of his former professional life. Perkins, a former chief economist at Boston strategic-consulting firm Chas. T. Main, says he was an "economic hit man" for 10 years, helping U.S. intelligence agencies and multinationals cajole and blackmail foreign leaders into serving U.S. foreign policy and awarding lucrative contracts to American business. "Economic hit men (EHMs) are highly paid professionals who cheat countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars," Perkins writes. Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is an extraordinary and gripping tale of intrigue and dark machinations. Think John Le Carré, except it's a true story.
636	Mingyuan Ma	1	I also think my older cousins thought it was funny to terrorise me. :/
637	Mingyuan Ma	3	**[Mongolian death worm] [link]The Mongolian death worm (Mongolian: олгой-хорхой, olgoi-khorkhoi, "large intestine worm") is a creature alleged to exist in the Gobi Desert. The creature first came to Western attention as a result of Roy Chapman Andrews's 1926 book On the Trail of Ancient Man. The American paleontologist described second-hand tales of the monster that he heard at a gathering of Mongolian officials: "None of those present ever had seen the creature, but they all firmly believed in its existence and described it minutely".
638	Mingyuan Ma	3	[outside link] Caitlín R. Kiernan is one of dark fantasy and horror’s most acclaimed and influential short fiction writers. Her powerful, unexpected stories shatter morality, gender, and sexuality: a reporter is goaded by her toxic girlfriend into visiting sadistic art exhibits; a countess in a decaying movie theater is sated by her servants; a collector offers his greatest achievement to ensnare a musician who grieves for her missing sister. In this retrospective collection of her finest work—previously only available in limited editions—Kiernan cuts straight to the heart of the emotional truths we cannot ignore.
639	Mingyuan Ma	2	Forget not that it is a city like all others. If you want to experience real interesting things, start an activity that will connect you to people in zurich. One of the greatest things is dancing: check out salsa and bachata if you want to experience greatest moments. Else i suggest sports like volleyball or cultural activities like sailing or bookdiscussion groups. Whatever stick to an activity, without it, wherever you go it seems boring and empty. With it great and all starts deveoping on its own

641	Mingyuan Ma	2	I remember when he was on the Raiders, he had a bookclub or blog about his read list
642	Mingyuan Ma	2	For strictly ELA, the kids like having sheets so I pull from Evan Moor (through teacher file box) and the Moffatt Girls (TPT). Then I just read from the books that interest us from the booklists of B+R and torchlight.
643	Mingyuan Ma	1	Possibly a sub like [r/AskLiteraryStudies][link]? It seems like r/books may be able to help? But literary studies does have a post near the top that makes it seem like they get a lot of questions they don't like answering so who knows...
644	Mingyuan Ma	1	his sub is kinda garbage IMO. Its turned into pop culture Oprah bookclub wishing for fairy magic stuff. You need to realize that everything is energy, so you need to find ways to get your internal world in tune with the reality you want. meditation and Neville Goddard as already suggested. The most important thing is you need to work with your subconscious to accept your affirmations or whatever.
645	Mingyuan Ma	3	[link] Lüshi (traditional Chinese: 律詩; simplified Chinese: 律诗; pinyin: lǜshī; Wade–Giles: lü-shih) refers to a specific form of Classical Chinese poetry verse form. One of the most important poetry forms of classical Chinese poetry, the lüshi refers to an eight-line regulated verse form with lines made up of five, six, or seven characters; thus:  Five-character eight-line regulated verse (wulü): a form of regulated verse with eight lines of five characters each. Six-character eight-line regulated verse is relatively rare. Seven-character eight-line regulated verse (qilü): a form of regulated verse with eight lines of seven characters each. 
646	Mingyuan Ma	2	/r/ScottMeyer was the best I could find. For a lot of, lets say not super popular authors, there's not going to be much better sadly, you'd be better off discussing it in /r/books, /r/bookdiscussion, /r/fantasy, and so on.
647	Mingyuan Ma	3	The incredible true story of the women who fought America's Undark dangerThe Curies' newly discovered element of radium makes gleaming headlines across the nation as the fresh face of beauty, and wonder drug of the medical community. From body lotion to tonic water, the popular new element shines bright in the otherwise dark years of the First World War.Meanwhile, hundreds of girls toil amidst the glowing dust of the radium-dial factories. The glittering chemical covers their bodies from head to toe; they light up the night like industrious fireflies. With such a coveted job, these "shining girls" are the luckiest alive—until they begin to fall mysteriously ill.But the factories that once offered golden opportunities are now ignoring all claims of the gruesome side effects, and the women's cries of corruption. And as the fatal poison of the radium takes hold, the brave shining girls find themselves embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of America's early 20th century, and in a groundbreaking battle for workers' rights that will echo for centuries to come.Written with a sparkling voice and breakneck pace, The Radium Girls fully illuminates the inspiring young women exposed to the "wonder" substance of radium, and their awe-inspiring strength in the face of almost impossible circumstances. Their courage and tenacity led to life-changing regulations, research into nuclear bombing, and ultimately saved hundreds of thousands of lives.
648	Mingyuan Ma	1	popheads takeover of /r/52book in action let's go
649	Mingyuan Ma	2	I found [this list] [link] on SocialJustice.org and there's a short list of books covering American slavery at the bottom of [this page][link]for middle readers. For the Chinese Exclusion Act, I found two books specifically mentioned [here][link]. Sadly, I haven't read *any* of the middle-level books listed on any of these pages, so I cannot make specific recommendations.
650	Mingyuan Ma	2	This was another The Alchemist for me. Everyone in my bookclub loved it and found it deeply insightful. I really wanted to like it but I just found it cliché. I agree with others that the protagonist wasn't relatable... things just kept happening to her. It was a frustrating read.
651	Mingyuan Ma	2	If I have a specific question about a particular book I am referencing, AskLiteraryStudies (or any classics-related forum) can be useful. I find that the more I work, the more my questions are about other books anyway.
652	Mingyuan Ma	1	I second this. My bookclub just finished this book this week and there's so many great lessons to learn in here.
653	Mingyuan Ma	3	[link]Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and soul-stirring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago, who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried near the Pyramids. 
654	Mingyuan Ma	1	The book is ok, there are better works by him.
655	Mingyuan Ma	3	Thought in which sense? In terms of literature, he (along with Keats and some other English Romantic poets) certainly had a large impact, especially on the Transcendentalists. His influence on Hemingway is very clear. For the first half of his life, Coleridge was not only a firm abolitionist, but also openly advocated the idea of full equality of all races in all manners. This modern liberalism (in fact, Coleridge in the first half of his life can be classified as a radical in terms contemporary to his time) found in his lectures and poems definitely influenced American artists' thought in the late nineteenth century and it can be argued that this contributed to the increased demand for some form of racial equality among *fin de siècle* artistic circles in the US. It must be noted, however, that in the second half of his live, Coleridge grew increasingly conservative, began to justify racism and slavery, and even advocated a form of proto-social Darwinism based off of the Bible, something to which he had previously vehemently argued humans should not defer in the context of race. You will likely get a more comprehensive answer if you ask this question on r/askliterarystudies. I hope this helps! :D
656	Mingyuan Ma	2	The bookclub Sub is in the middle of one actually.  They are starting SoS next month.  It seems a lot of them plan on attempting to do the Cosmere after, so it might not be a bad idea to set up a Cosmere one, start with a Mistborn read along now to try and line up with the book club ending theirs with the release and presumable reading of TLM.    Then all the bookclubbers can hope on over for a continuation into the deeper Cosmere.
657	Mingyuan Ma	2	Mods may shortly remind you of rule 3
658	Mingyuan Ma	2	I've just settled with the idea that this sub is about booksI figured that out just from the name.not literature.Well, as literature is a subset of books in general, it doesn't make sense that this sub would be strictly about literature. As luck would have it, though, there is a sub entirely devoted to literature. It's called /r/literature. If you want a sub dedicated to book discussions (vs. anything generally about books), you might try /r/bookdiscussion. That seems to be a lightly populated sub right now, so it seems like a handful of users (say, for instance, the ones in threads like this complaining of a lack of book discussion) could go over there and make it into the kind of  sub they want /r/books to be. There is also, /r/bookclub, which is also dominated by book discussion. Though they are obviously primarily focused on the current books of the month, not exclusively so.
659	Mingyuan Ma	1	It was the most difficult book I've ever Read Run/ bookclub!!
660	Mingyuan Ma	1	While I don't want to slight this subreddit, I think you've got a lot more chance of getting a comprehensive answer to this on a sub like r/AskLiteraryStudies, r/classics, or perhaps r/AskHistorians.
661	Mingyuan Ma	2	There's No Bookclub Jeff award
662	Mingyuan Ma	2	It was a slower week for me. * I read **The Black Tides of Heaven, by Neon Yang**: I loved the worldbuilding behind this silkpunk novella, there’s simply a massive influx of creativity obvious here. That said, I had some issues with the pacing the characterizations, in all it just felt a bit rushed.* 85% complete and will soon finish **Dune Messiah, by Frank Herbert**. The climax is really compelling! I will absolutely be moving ahead with Children of Dune after this. * Done 6 out of 9 short stories in **Exhalation; Stories, by Ted Chiang.** This has been such a wonderful reading experience. Top stories so far are the Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate, Exhalation (the title story), and Truth of Fact, Truth of Feeling (which I read this morning and absolutely adored). * 25% complete **Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead**, **by Olga Tokarczuk.** I'm really enjoying it. Surprisingly laugh-out-loud funny at some points, and just such creative fiction here. 
663	Mingyuan Ma	1	 I'm thinking central Phoenix to North Tempe/South Scottsdale area. Open to other ideas though. 
664	Mingyuan Ma	1	Get a pet. Make some friends. Join a bookclub. Join a church. There are many ways not to be lonely. I love my kids, but they have their own lives, and one of them lives a couple of thousand miles from me. They don’t belong to me, and it’s not their job to make me happy
665	Mingyuan Ma	1	She is already a pretty big name in Malayam, and this novel has made her a pretty big name in translated fiction circles. Check it out if you are looking for any regional stuff.I want to read Indian stuff more man. I'm so oblivious to it that it's straight up shamefulI've got a book downloaded I still need to get to that. Ugh fuck my lazy arse.
666	Mingyuan Ma	1	I started listening to downtown for the Christmas music and it's ended up just being on in my car, and it's fucking cat. None of the presenters have any personality to speak of, there's even a show where they have two guys on and between them they don't have a personality. There's a woman with a monotone who sounds like she's either brainwashed or reading off a page.So not that.U105 is a bit better but if you're really listening to it it's awful. They play the same songs far too often and you'll never want to hear Oops Upside Your Head ever again. They have three newreaders who eternally sound like it's their first day on the job and they are sitting dying after being up all night taking coke. Carolyn Stewart's show is pretty good, Frank Mitchell's can be depending on what he's talking about but that's more down to the people who ring in.
667	Mingyuan Ma	2	There's also the [weekly recommendation thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2mgd3p/weekly_recommendation_thread_for_the_week_of/) and the various recommendation subs pulled from this [List of book related subs](http://www.reddit.com/r/BookRelatedSubs/wiki/sublist)
668	Mingyuan Ma	2	I think celebrity memoir Bookclub (the podcast) has done stassis. I haven’t heard that episode but they usually spill all the tea and have some good banter.
669	Mingyuan Ma	1	Our post Mormon bookclub read “Zealot” last year! It made so much more sense to me than anything I had heard at church. We also read “sapiens” and “who wrote the Bible” Right around the same time and that was pretty much it for me! Highly recommend this trio of books!
670	Mingyuan Ma	2	Your post is better suited to the [link] or /r/52book.

673	Mingyuan Ma	1	That’s really no different than this little millionaire booklet I saw being talked about on Instagram 5-7 years ago. It had the millionaire mindset to get to a millionaire status and people were including it all over their booklists. It was $7 dollars so I bought one out of curiosity. Pretty much just a TLDR of one or two rich dad poor dad quotes mixed in with a you just need to sell a $20 product 50,000 times, or a $200 product 5,000 times, etc. So your dad had a joke but people do it all the time lol

Something like these books might work: [link]
675	Mingyuan Ma	3	If you read my post you’d see that I had already started one of the books for a book club I joined, so I was definitely not looking for recommendations in that regard. I was looking for comments that would inspire good discussion, like the first comment saying that I should definitely read Ready Player One prior to watching the movie.  
676	Mingyuan Ma	2	Just found r/52book which seems like a more chill bookclub. Probably a good spot to search for bookbuddies as well.
677	Mingyuan Ma	2	As a kid I was constantly reading. I zapped right through 500 page Harry Potter books. As a teen I hardly read any books. I also didn't read a lot of the litterature I had to read for school. I just memorized a summary I found online. Yes, I know, I'm trash, but I honestly got better grades when I didn't read the book, because in tests and book reports I focussed less on unimportant details. As an adult I really wanted to read more, because I do like it, but I often started books, but didn't finish them, because I lost interest. What helped me read more as an adult was start a bookclub so I had to read at least one book a month. Also, weirdly Goodreads helped me read more, because you can update your progress and see an overview of the books you've read in a year. That just gives a little serotonine boost whenever I update my progress or finish a book. Last year I read 34 books.
678	Mingyuan Ma	1	In the book I'm looking for, the boy and his parents are kind of the only vampires where they live besides the enemy vampires from what I can remember! I've looked through many of the vampire book lists on Goodreads and couldn't find it so I'm assuming it's not very well known which makes it so much harder to find.
679	Mingyuan Ma	3	Please post lists of books in /r/booklists.
680	Mingyuan Ma	2	This is a sub for pictures of people's bookshelves. /r/books, /r/bookdiscussion, /r/paranormalromance, and /r/YALit would be better places for this.
681	Mingyuan Ma	1	Oh, my bad.In this case, my number one advice—trite as it may be—is to *write much* and to *read even more*. 
682	Mingyuan Ma	1	I got you fam.Here you go /u/syphilis_pretzel. The link, is on the sidebar.[link]
683	Mingyuan Ma	2	Yes, I did. It was phenomenal. [Here][link]  are my thoughts.
684	Mingyuan Ma	2	I was taking with someone about making a queer/butch bookclub discord
685	Mingyuan Ma	1	Let me know if you're interested and send me a message! Have a great day :)
686	Mingyuan Ma	1	You should check out /r/52book, it’s a challenge to read at least 1 book a week for a year.Lol, I have zero aspiration to do anything close to this with my free time.
687	Mingyuan Ma	3	If you are unclear about the removal reason you should ask in reply to the mod comment in your original post, or send a question to modmail.Here is the relevant section of rules regarding book lists, with the specific part bolded. No low quality book lists. To maintain quality, the list must encourage discussion. For linked lists the list itself must have descriptive paragraphs for each book. Users are also encouraged to submit their own unique lists as a self/text-post. **Original lists should have at least a paragraph explaining the reason for the list and include some further thoughts on at least a few of the books.** The poster must have actually read each book. Alternatively, there is /r/booklists.If you are still unclear about why your post was removed please reply here or use modmail.
688	Mingyuan Ma	3	I'm a witch who's been practicing since the 1980s, and I'm a big book nerd too.  I've been putting together lists of some of the better books on various witchy topics such as working with herbs, trance work, spirits, and have the lists available at my website here: [link]You should probably also check out some of the other witch-related subreddits as they often have lists of recommended books in their FAQs and wikis, and the participants are pretty good about suggesting books if you ask for specific topics.  Check out r/witchcraft, r/WitchesVsPatriarchy, r/SASSWitches, r/paganism, r/FriendlyPagans, r/witchcraftbookclub,   r/realwitchcraft and r/AskWitches in particular.
689	Mingyuan Ma	1	I read a lot!  You should join r/52book!  You don’t have to have a goal of 52 any goal is fine and it’s a nice chill welcoming book sub.
690	Mingyuan Ma	1	lets make one...would be like a bookclub...every week we get a new cock to suck and chat about it...every week? is that too infrequent hehe
691	Mingyuan Ma	1	Man this sub really needs a rule about not posting homework help, /r/askliterarystudies already has one.
692	Mingyuan Ma	1	What an original post 😱!: [link]

694	Mingyuan Ma	3	Klara and the Sun is the eighth novel by the Nobel Prize-winning British writer Kazuo Ishiguro, published on 2 March 2021. It is a dystopian science fiction story. Set in the U.S. in an unspecified future, the book is told from the point of view of Klara, a solar-powered AF (Artificial Friend), who is chosen by Josie, a sickly child, to be her companion. The novel was longlisted for the 2021 Booker Prize.
695	Mingyuan Ma	1	Sidebar....
696	Mingyuan Ma	2	I meant she needs to do something like a bookclub and not rely on you for her social needs. She should not be attempting to make her happiness your responsibility.
697	Mingyuan Ma	1	I also told him that I think it would be a good idea for him to talk to a counselor or therapist at least once to get some advice on how to deal with someone who is so emotionally abusive and cruel. And besides, I just can't keep hearing about how awful she is every other day. It's too distressing and triggering for me.
698	Mingyuan Ma	2	You probably haven't experienced discrimination based on anti-paganism or anti-atheism. Think it was the 90s or 00s that being non-conforming to religion actually became somewhat accepted without social or economic repercussion, in most places.
699	Mingyuan Ma	1	go ahead she needs more friends for her bookclub i think
700	Mingyuan Ma	2	Is there a box immediately above your post here saying “Check out r/AskLiteraryStudies”?
701	Mingyuan Ma	3	You'll be better served at /r/askliterarystudies
702	Mingyuan Ma	2	In seattle, there’s Ye Olde Curiosity Shoppe and a great horror movie section at MoPop.
703	Mingyuan Ma	1	I know this may sound goofy but I’ve been trying to train myself to put down the phone and pick up the kindle or a paper book whenever I see a picture of a book/read list/post in /r/books or /r/52book (I just got curious about this post and clicked in)
704	Mingyuan Ma	1	I love the discussion post style bookclub. I'm new to Reddit and came from a discord/video call bookclub so this is totally different! You're not put on the spot, you can pick and choose what you respond to, word vomit a little without interrupting anyone. I certainly didn't appreciate it enough in school lol.
705	Mingyuan Ma	1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit
706	Mingyuan Ma	3	Check out the r/broomclosetwitch wiki, they have links to occult PDF libraries might be helpful. Also try r/heathery, they've posted a few links to booklists if I remember correctly.
707	Mingyuan Ma	1	Oh my fucking god 😂😂
708	Mingyuan Ma	1	I legit think you/your husband would be surprised how many "literary" readers also read similar level books - everyone I know that reads a lot (and in the more "highbrow" reas like classics or whatever) also read percy jackson, artemis fowl etc. 
709	Mingyuan Ma	2	Are all the parents going to work and add value to society, or will some just join a bookclub.
710	Mingyuan Ma	1	u/migmatite_rock You're two examples are blatantly political and don't represent much of what constitutes literary theory although they may represent what is often on reddit.My colleague did not direct to r/AskLiteraryStudies, and I would send you there.This is something entirely different than the things that Eagleton gets published in journals about writers like Dickens (an which i admittedly have not read).If you have a specific item you're reading, send me a message in chat and I will not hesitate to help you if I can.  However, if your question is on the specific nature of literary criticism, I'm going to warn you that you will be met with hostility, and that the best place to ask for assistance is probably r/AskLiteraryStudies.  It's not the duty of people on reddit in a book forum to defend the practice of literary criticism.  No one here owes you any time.  As I said, I will happily, in my own time, do what I can, but concern trolling is trolling and there are forums where asking difficult questions about literary theory are really the main point of the forum ( r/AskLiteraryStudies).

712	Mingyuan Ma	1	There was a story that Searle told at one point about Foucault, where Searle asked Foucault You're so clear when speaking to me, so why the hell do you write so badly?  And Foucault said In France, if you don't have at least 10% incomprehensibility, people don't think you're very profound.  (I don't have the direct quote but it was basically that).
713	Mingyuan Ma	2	also /r/bookdiscussion exists as well
714	Mingyuan Ma	2	[link]You can do it through a book or a movie first before talking about a child. Like find a book or a movie with an autistic character and watch it a few times together
715	Mingyuan Ma	1	/r/books hot threads are truly the bottom of the barrel for book related shit lmao. i still like the what are you reading threads and sometimes if you can catch something that doesnt get more than 50 comments it's ok.  seconding /r/52book as a good alternative! it's very fun and positive and generally less... weird about specific books/genres/audiences. i also have been having a pretty good time in /r/Fantasy (tho big threads can still get weird) and also there are too many authors i like with active accounts! i don't want to be perceived by authors ever thank you. agree on /r/YAlit having good vibes too tho i'm not really a ya reader anymore.i also hang out in /r/HobbyDrama and /r/iamveryculinary and stop by like... /r/houseplants every so often
716	Mingyuan Ma	3	I'll list a some books in a few different categories that I think might fit what you're suggesting. None of these are very unique or obscure, as a lot of these are from advanced language arts classes I had in high school and college. They did give a good general base of knowledge and were all interesting reads at worst, and formative at best. That's also not to say I liked all of them - but I'll put my thoughts later. Some of these are in my personal library as well. **Nonfiction*** Philosophy/Politics   * *Apology* and *Phaedo* by Plato; both chronicle events towards the end of Socrates' life, and as far as philosophy can be funny, the *Apology* is    * *The Prince* by Machiavelli; I won't lie, I despise the principles in this book, but it explains (to me) a lot of why the world is the way that it is    * As far as Christian philosophy goes, I would recommend anything by C.S. Lewis (yes, the guy that wrote Narnia), especially *Mere Christianity* if you're looking into apologetics. I've also heard good things about *The Screwtape Letters* if you want something a bit more readable, though I haven't read that one personally. Dante's *Divine Comedy* is another option, if a bit tedious to get through. * Other   * *Into Thin Air* by Jon Krakauer; I cannot recommend this book enough. I've also read *Into the Wild* but I didn't find it quite as compelling as this one   * *In Cold Blood* by Truman Capote; a good read if you're at all interested in crime stories (side note: there is a fascinating conspiracy that Capote is actually the author of *To Kill a Mockingbird*)   * *On Writing* by Stephen King for some reason; not sure why this one stuck with me but it sure did    * *The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat* by Oliver Sacks; saw it mentioned elsewhere in this thread too. Good book, humorous for what content it contains**Fiction*** Race relations/Black history   * *The Help* by Kathryn Stockett; fantastic movie and even better book   * *Beloved* by Toni Morrison; frankly any book by her is worth a read * Sociology?    * *Let the Great World Spin* by Colum McCann; probably up there with the best books I've ever read and probably #1 on this whole list   * *The Scarlet Letter* by Nathaniel Hawthorne   * *The Poisonwood Bible* by Barbara Kingsolver* Psychology    * *Room* by Emma Donoghue; gripping and chilling and in general an amazing read* Shakespeare   * I really liked *Othello* and *The Merchant of Venice*. *Hamlet* is a good read because you'll find similar plot structures in a lot of famous things (it gets contrasted with the Lion King a lot)So that's a brief list of reads that I found most memorable/helpful/worldview-refining. 
717	Mingyuan Ma	1	A good time to do it! Semi-related: a bookclub friend read all the *Dune* stuff -- meaning the ones by Frank Herbert (6) and the ones by his son, Brian, which was something insane like 25. More or less back-to-back (he had to slot in the club reads of course). I don't know how he did on it. I couldn't keep my reading that focused. I need some variety.
718	Mingyuan Ma	1	Not everyone in 52book does 52 - it’s absolutely ‘pick your own number’. Last year I aimed for 50 so I could give myself a couple of weeks leeway
719	Mingyuan Ma	2	Yes, it happens in /r/AskLiteraryStudies a fair amount. [quote].
720	Mingyuan Ma	2	There is a [bookdiscussion][link] subreddit that looks like it never got off of the ground, but it could if enough of us participated in it.  I love reading /literature and /printsf, but they certainly don't cover most of what I actually read.
721	Mingyuan Ma	1	We are here . . . r/52book
722	Mingyuan Ma	2	maybe /r/whattolistenwhen could help? if it's still active, it's a sister sub to /r/whattoreadwhen
723	Mingyuan Ma	2	Well known classics. I'm trying to go through the interesting books on the PBS Great American Read list. An excellent place to find a book if I'm stuck on what to read next.
724	Mingyuan Ma	1	Try out This Is How You Lose The Time War.
725	Mingyuan Ma	1	This. I joined r/52book last year, and on the whole it was really great. But the completionist in me started pushing through books I didn't really want to, just to get "credit", and I was also flying through books when I didn't feel like reading.I don't want it to be like that. Trying to find my personal middle ground between goal setting and burning out.
726	Mingyuan Ma	3	You should post it on /r/suggestmeabook or /r/whattoreadwhen. These subs are more suitable for recommendations.
727	Mingyuan Ma	2	Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure. Now I'll take my bookish snobbery somewhere else. Perhaps /r/literature or /r/newbooks or maybe even /r/bookdiscussion
728	Mingyuan Ma	1	just recently this children's book was released showing gay porn to kids. a fucking children's reading bookclub was inviting this weird costumed man with a cock.

734	Mingyuan Ma	2	How much energy does it cost to ignore people? If you don't want to hear about the movie, then listen to something else, like music.And it IS unreasonable to expect him to not even talk about the movie/his interests with his friends (especially when you only asked him to not talk about it with you).
735	Mingyuan Ma	3	You’re most likely going to be sent to r/suggestmeabook, r/booksuggestions, or r/whattoreadwhen. They have serious bibliographers who can help you out.
736	Mingyuan Ma	2	/r/bookdiscussion ? It seems mostly abandoned, but the mods are still active in other subs, so if they're not interested in moderating, perhaps they could add someone from here who wants to do it.
737	Mingyuan Ma	3	look up Charlotte Mason booklists for you child's age.
738	Mingyuan Ma	1	Okay mod hat off.So none of these were what you were looking for?

739	Mingyuan Ma	2	r/RomanceBooks is a good place to go for romance suggestionsI'd also suggest r/52book it's ostensibly for folks trying to read a book a week but I find a bunch of great books from what other folks are reading.

740	Mingyuan Ma	1	Gotta respect it regardless, my way of kings hardback is ‘bookclub edition’ so it’s an inch shorter than all the others on my shelf 🙈
741	Mingyuan Ma	3	A few scattered thoughts and suggestions:- Journals: If you believe your work is good enough, just submit to your favourite journals in your field. Chances are the journals you enjoy reading would also like the kind of things you write. Go for a more specialised journal if the big ones seem intimidating. You should put a bit of thought into it, though, since you can only submit an article to one at a time.- University departments: AFAIK, American universities will be fine with a much vague PhD project than European ones, where you'll be expected to go in and start working right away, while there's usually a year or two of coursework (like a second MA) in the US. Other people will have more precise recommendations, I hope.- If you have any literary interests at all, check out comparative literature departments in the US, as well as English and modern language departments. This last might be a bit of an awkward fit for you as your interests are in German but that's not one of your languages.- /r/AskLiteraryStudies is good if you do look at lit departments. There's also /r/ComparativeLiterature, but it's quite small. /r/GradSchool might be good too, but I don't know that sub at all.
742	Mingyuan Ma	3	Try /r/TrueBooks or /r/CurrentlyReading other /r/bookdiscussion subs seem to be inactive. 
743	Mingyuan Ma	1	I'll be honest I get most of my updates on happenings in the US from The Daily Show and The LAte Show. &amp;#x200B;Sad sign when I trust comedians to get it right than actual newreaders
744	Mingyuan Ma	1	2021 was the year I tried audiobooks for the first time. But I just needed to have the physical copies too. It's a bad habit I'm trying to overcome. I have had some REALLY good reads this year. I rated them in tiers (I regret putting "Shout" in good and not great) I hope this answers your question. [Books rated in tiers][link]
745	Mingyuan Ma	2	Might be worth asking this on r/AskLiteraryStudies if you have not done so yet
746	Mingyuan Ma	1	I'll have to try Story Graph.Zlib has two separate features for keep track of books, Favorites and Booklists. They're both great and really well coded. I much prefer the layout of the booklists to the favorites and I'm trying to migrate all my favorites over there, but you have to do it one book at a time and I have 35 pages of them :(
747	Mingyuan Ma	2	r/bookclub are doing a read along of this right now also if you’re interested.
748	Mingyuan Ma	2	Chaiery was told by booksmarts that some people might not think she is black enough to say the word nigga casually. He said she should probably stop. They apparently had an argument at the time and reached no satifactory conclusion, later on stream Chaiery talked about the interaction and how she thought that booksmart was just too scared to say that he thought she wasn't black enough to say nigga and was hiding behind an imaginary group of people who wouldn't think she was black enough. Memes ensued but I'm not part of the bookclub so I don't know if he's actually getting cancelled or if people are just clowning him on twitter.
749	Mingyuan Ma	3	I will be messaging you in 14 days.
750	Mingyuan Ma	1	Yep. Looks like your post violates this rule of that subreddit: [link]
751	Mingyuan Ma	3	You should ask this on r/askliterarystudies, since it's been removed here.
752	Mingyuan Ma	2	If you haven't done so yet, come and join everyone in r/52book. The challenge is to read 1 book a week for a year but really it's just about setting out your own goals. Whether it's 5 or 100.
753	Mingyuan Ma	2	I’m new to the 52book challenge and I’d love to make some friends. I like fantasy, sci-fi, and fiction. Currently finishing up Dune. I’d love some recommendations and discussions! [Goodreads][link]
754	Mingyuan Ma	1	 Forever Never is dual POV :) You can probably find a lot of recs that are by using the search function. You might run into some rants from folks who don't like it (I do) but people mention it or ask the question often enough that you should be able to find some good recs! I remember seeing The Bromance Bookclub getting shout outs as a fun one for men to read but I haven't read it yet myself. 
755	Mingyuan Ma	2	Our kids prefer to own most of their books so they can share and re-read. Libraries have book sales. Try booksalefinder.com. The Mensa website has good booklists broken down by age group. You can also google top 100 kids chapter books of all time and start there.
756	Mingyuan Ma	2	/r/linguistics or /r/askhistorians or /r/askliterarystudies would be better places to find this info.
757	Mingyuan Ma	1	I think it has a good story, the lack of difficulty or progression ruins it for me though. I really don’t need the uniquely named overland drop and there are better ways of gaining experience. I guess my issue is, I want to play the game not watch a movie.
758	Mingyuan Ma	1	I don't think there's a good catch-all term here... though you could check with r/askliterarystudies as it's possible there's something more defined in that world that could be applied here.I've seen people use "Thematic Shift" to discuss the technique you seem to be describing. Though, I think that term applies pretty well to *Hereditary* and less so to something like *Mulholland Drive.*
759	Mingyuan Ma	1	When I was 6/7 yo this album scared the shit out of me.  I wasn't old enough to appreciate that voices coming though the speakers speaking like newsreaders *weren't actually newreaders*.

This incredible teaching tool contains Interpretive Analysis, Folk Song Sources, Teacher's Lesson Plan and Student Learning Guide. Written for any band or orchestra conductor planning to perform this work. An outstanding teaching tool that applies the MENC "Standards" to the podium. A "MUST HAVE" for the serious wind band conductor!
761	Mingyuan Ma	1	Thank you for posting this! I have been very dismayed to see some of the attitudes from FFA bubbling over into my real life. I’m in the US and in a bookclub of 8 women in their 30s. Pretty much every meeting there’s a conversation about being too old for fashion. People talk about buying cheap leggings from Costco because they don’t want to spend money on clothes and how nothing fits their decrepit 35-year-old body. The Costco leggings are my real life version of the greige sack. Ugh! I hate this attitude! Of course, not everyone is into fashion and has money to spend on it, but I feel the prevailing attitude is that if you are over 30 and not a size 2, fashion is not for you and you are frivolous for thinking about it.
762	Mingyuan Ma	1	There's a lot of subreddits for different genres! (though they have varying levels of activity). Here are a few: /r/fantasy /r/romancenovels /r/YAlit /r/DystopianBooks /r/HorrorLit /r/paranormalromance /r/urbanfantasy /r/GraphicNovelsThere's also some other subreddits that are geared towards discussing books (again, varying levels of activity):/r/BookDiscussion /r/CurrentlyReading /r/JustFinishedReading /r/TrueBooksFinally, there are subreddits devoted to specific series or authors, like /r/lotr or /r/KingKillerChronicle .(if none of those float your boat, check out a full list [here][link]
763	Mingyuan Ma	1	Hmm, I'll poke around and see if I can find some good book recommendations - most of my stuff is sci-fi and fantasy. You might venture over to /r/books or /r/whattoreadwhen and check with their librarians! \^^
764	Mingyuan Ma	1	Opened the movie, skipped to the random point and the one enacting shakuni delivers the dialogue "yudhishthira has one weakness, he loves gambling". Loves gambling!!! I am pretty sure it is a wrong claim, don't watch it.
765	Mingyuan Ma	3	I will be messaging you in 4 days on to remind you of [**this link**][link]
766	Mingyuan Ma	1	r/whattoreadwhen is kinda slow, but could work as well
767	Mingyuan Ma	1	Idk I’ve been doing a 52 book challenge on r/52book for like 8ish years now. It’s mainly a way to make myself carve out time for reading. The first year was definitely a stretch and these days I don’t always make it to 52, sometimes more sometimes less, but it has been a great way to keep up a good habit.
768	Mingyuan Ma	3	The German sociologist Dominik Schrage wrote a genealogy of consumption called *Die Verfügbarkeit der Dinge* in 2009. While the book has not yet received an English translation, Schrage has at least published a [short summary][link]A classic that nobody has recommended so far - and that you are probably aware of anyway - but which I thought worth mentioning is Pierre Bourdieu's *Distinction*. An earlier classic well worth a read is Georg Simmel. Most of his *oeuvre* might prove a useful tool to make sense of the urbanization processes and accompanying lifestyle changes during the late 19th and early 20th century - and, given that Walter Benjamin had extensively read Simmel (cf. Marian Mičko, *Walter Benjamin und Georg Simmel*) it might be worth reading alongside Benjamin's *Arcades*. A good primer on Simmel's theories and their usefulness in literary studies is Julie Choi's [link]. (As I can imagine that you either already have read or will be reading Theodore Dreiser's *Sister Carrie*, you might also be interested in Ulfried Reichardt's "[Counting Success and Measuring Value: Money, Numbers, and Abstraction in Theodore Dreiser's 'Sister Carrie'][link]" in which he reads *Sister Carrie* through (and alongside) Georg Simmel's *Philosophy of Money*.)Two of Simmel's essays that immediately came to my mind are "The Metropolis and Mental Life" and "[Fashion][link]". In the former, Simmel explores the differences in social relations and individual psyche between rural and urban areas and - among other things - argues, that the city dweller has to become increasingly excentric as not to vanish in the anonymous crowds of the metropolis. In the latter - which might be especially useful whenever shopping practices revolve around clothing and/or the pursuit of changing trends - Simmel postulates that fashion is a form of imitation and so of social equalization, but, paradoxically, in changing incessantly, it differentiates one time from another and one social stratum from another. It unites those of a social class and segregates them from others. (Simmel 541)You might also want to cross-post to r/AskLiteraryStudies, if you haven't done so already.
769	Mingyuan Ma	2	r/books gave you permission to post this on r/AskLiteraryStudies ?
770	Mingyuan Ma	1	I know, that makes me so sad. :(  Can you imagine her poor boyfriend innocently getting excited over a movie and sharing his excitement with his friend, only to have her shit all over it for no reason as he wasn't even talking to her about it?  Geez, she probably ruined the film for him.  And is going to make him now second-guess bringing up other movies to his friends because he's worried he's annoying them, too.
771	Mingyuan Ma	1	Oh I'm not sure, you can try asking at r/askliterarystudies

You are setting up ways to protect yourself and detach yourself from the situation.**  I would distance yourself from both Josh, and from any discussions about Josh, except for reporting incidents.  I would also look into a decent lock on your bedroom door, so you can have privacy and protect your stuff.   And when you are done with school, I would look into the booklists on these subs and start to read about toxic people and toxic homes and learn how living there has affected you, and how to process and heal from it all.
776	Mingyuan Ma	2	Hey you should join r/52book if you've not already. I joined last year with the intention of reading 12 in a year and made it to 62. It was a great place to find new suggestions to read.
777	Mingyuan Ma	3	To summon this bot, the first line of your comment should be: /u/user_history_bot USERNAME
778	Mingyuan Ma	2	Right here is why they don't tell you anything. Never had to learn the lesson of "don't post anything online you wouldn't want your parents to hear" cus I already learned not to tell the parents anything I didn't want 14 Facebook pages and the Friday Church bookclub to know about
779	Mingyuan Ma	2	The best place to post your list is r/52book
780	Mingyuan Ma	1	Fingers crossed! :D
781	Mingyuan Ma	3	I apologize for being overly aggressive in my comment. Maybe because English isn’t your native language, your post came across as egotistic. What struck a nerve was that you were separating people into categories of intelligent and not intelligent and seemed to imply that the latter has nothing you could benefit from. This may not be what you meant, that’s just how it sounded.
782	Mingyuan Ma	3	Life is a journey of ups and downs, twists and turns, and everything in between. Watch Blake Belladonna as she navigates this uncertain road from start to finish, child to woman and more. She'll love and hate, lose and gain, and find out just how important family is in a world that does all it can to tear you down. Ladybug, Freezerburn on the side. Cover art by booksandweapons.
783	Mingyuan Ma	1	I agree with this 100%. All of the friends I made in college were in different majors than me! I hated the other history students! I joined a bookclub at my college and at the public library as well.
784	Mingyuan Ma	3	Euphuism is a peculiar mannered style of English prose. It takes its name from a prose romance  by John Lyly. It consists of a preciously ornate and sophisticated style, employing a deliberate excess of literary devices such as antitheses, alliterations, repetitions and  rhetorical questions. Classical learning and remote knowledge of all kinds are displayed.
785	Mingyuan Ma	3	Go to r/bookdiscussion
786	Mingyuan Ma	2	Ah, The Jungle. That was the first book I decided I didn’t have to finish. I’ll tell you when I quit reading it when you’re done. As far how the reading goes, if you just want to discuss the book once we’ve finished, I think we can just post on r/52book. If you want to have an ongoing discussion as we read, we might need a different sub.  r/Buddyread is a pretty empty sub and that might work for us as it’s uncluttered.
787	Mingyuan Ma	3	Here's a direct link to this group's recommended book list: [link]Since the group's own list is just at the beginning stage (only a few books listed there) here are some themed lists I've put together over the years that might interest you: [link]
788	Mingyuan Ma	1	Yep, it's never a bad idea to read through a sub's rules before posting:
789	Mingyuan Ma	2	r/badliterature r/askliterarystudies r/literature (the third one is only okay.) for some humor check out r/badreads (bad book reviews) and r/bookscirclejerk (making fun of the (mostly) morons on r/books). i also like r/bookcollecting cause a lot of cool rare books get posted and you can silently judge people’s personal libraries.
790	Mingyuan Ma	1	You’re gonna hate me for saying this, but he did visit a pyramid.
791	Mingyuan Ma	1	Aydra Richards is a fairly new regency HR author with ~600 total Goodreads ratings across her six published books. /u/Curious-Monk-6489 gave her a rec here, but I still wasn't expecting too much. Though some elements of her writing style took a bit of getting used to, I was shocked at how good the book was overall. I've since read most of her back catalogue and they are all home runs. I read a lot of regency historicals and I think she is now in my top three favourite authors in the category.
792	Mingyuan Ma	2	Indeed. I could see something of an argument for that if the OP has only listened NADDPOD C2, but even in that, everybody generally gets a good amount of screen time on NADDPOD. I can not make any definitive statement as to how she is on 8-Bit Bookclub, but given that the OP calls NADDPOD “her (Emily’s) show” makes me think he has listened to neither, as yes, NADDPOD is very much  equally everyone on it’s show as well.
793	Mingyuan Ma	2	We found about 95%of level K books at our library.  But we also have a spectacular library system. The booklists for LG and BYL are both available for free on their websites without purchasing the curriculum
794	Mingyuan Ma	1	Wow, that is really super helpful from a subreddit called "AskLiteraryStudies". Go fuck yourself.
795	Mingyuan Ma	1	Join a club on meetup! Every time I have moved cities I have joined a bookclub and made new friends!
796	Mingyuan Ma	2	Definitely! Here’s my list….            -only read what you enjoy. If a books not doing it for you put it down. You can always give it another chance later.            -find a quite dim spot with minimal distractions. I always read in bed at night because that’s when everyone else is asleep and won’t interrupt me.          -cut out tv/streaming. Seems weird at first but once you get into a good book tv loses its appeal.            -get rid of social media. Especially FB. It’s just designed to bait you into arguments anyway. I make exceptions for book related platforms like Reddit or Bookstagram. It’s been 3 years and I don’t miss a single thing about FB.-buy cheap used books or use the library. That way you can sift through a wide variety of books for minimal monies. Some used book shops have mint condition books for $4.-join in on the r/52book subreddit. That’s what motivated me to start reading more and it’s been a lot of fun over the years. I found great recommendations and had some really good interactions with other Redditors                -always carry a book with you. You never know when you’ll find an extra 15 minutes to read. And all those little chunks really add up. I did that less in 2021 and you can see the above results.              Those are my main bookish habits that keep me reading at a high rate. Even at 100+ books it doesn’t feel like I’m forcing myself. It’s just reading for pleasure. I hope that helps!
797	Mingyuan Ma	3	Winner of the prestigious Gold Dagger Award in the U.K. for the best mystery of 1999, this complex literary thriller may be one of the most satisfying suspense novels to come along in some time. Robert Wilson has written several political thrillers, most of which are set in West Africa, but they are, alas, largely unavailable in the U.S.In A Small Death in Lisbon, the narrative switches back and forth between 1941 and 1999, and Wilson's wide knowledge of history and keen sense of place make the eras equally vibrant. In 1941 Germany, Klaus Felsen, an industrialist, is approached by the SS high command in a none-too-friendly manner and is "persuaded" to go to Lisbon and oversee the sale--or smuggling--of wolfram (also known as tungsten, used in the manufacture of tanks and airplanes). World War II Portugal is neutral where business is concerned, and too much of the precious metal is being sold to Britain when Germany needs it to insure that Hitler's blitzkrieg is successful.

799	Mingyuan Ma	2	I use goodreads, and look at what "lists" the book I like is on, browse by genre, etc.  I also like to go on here and read the /r/booksuggestions or /r/whattoreadwhen .  If i have something specific I want I post but usually I find posts that other people have written that I can relate to as well.
800	Mingyuan Ma	1	It is a horrible game if you were looking for L.A.NOIRE style mystery solving game where the thrill is in the act of putting the pieces of mystery back together in a climactic showdown. I sincerely think you should drop it. Forcing yourself through would be a massive boring waste of time, like being forced to read latin literature about some ancient dead guys you don't care about.
801	Mingyuan Ma	3	I really have no trouble with finding what next to read, on the contrary, so I'll try and share a few tips.Goodreads - their recommendation algorithm sucks, so don't use it. You can use it in 3 ways:- seeing what your friends read - this one is most valuable to me. I know what I respect in other people reading habits, so when I see something they like, I will take notice of it.-book lists - these are not as useful, but I take a look sometime- blog posts - they occasionally have cool blog posts listing books, so I take a look at that, and sometimes find something interestingReddit:- /r/booklists - check occasionally and see what you like- see what other people read on this subreddit
802	Mingyuan Ma	2	This is why I joined Reddit, /r/booksuggestions, /r/suggestmeabook, /r/52book. After I spent some time learning there, a visit to the library or a real bookstore feels like a trip to Disneyland.
803	Mingyuan Ma	1	Interestingly enough, almost this exact question has come up before. The answers there may be of use. There are a few flippant comments, but most are helpful
804	Mingyuan Ma	3	So even when a patient gets a UTI, the treatment is not a circumcision. The treatment is a simple round of antibiotics. Keep in mind that removing body parts is considered the absolute last resort, to be entertained only when all other options are exhausted. And that's for when pathology is actually present. Doing it beforehand is honestly bizarre when we're dealing with someone else's genitals. It's the most private and personal body part.
805	Mingyuan Ma	3	this sub has a few recommended booklists in the sidebar [link]
806	Mingyuan Ma	3	Check out r/heathenry wiki for Nordic booklists. Check out r/broomclosetwitch wiki for links to free PDF libraries and booklists.
807	Mingyuan Ma	3	We have chosen to allow book discussion, but only on designated threads. So if you want to discuss the books or any spoilers from them, you should make a separate post on the subreddit and flag it as [BookDiscussion/BookSpoilers]. We want to wall off the books from the rest of the discussions here.
808	Mingyuan Ma	3	**[Gilbert schema for Ulysses][link] This schema for the novel Ulysses was produced by its author, James Joyce, in November 1921 in order to help his friend, Valery Larbaud, prepare a public lecture on the novel, which Joyce was still writing at the time. The lecture took place on 7 December 1921 at the Maison des Amis des Livres bookshop and lending library, owned and run by Adrienne Monnier. The schema was shown to intimates of Joyce during the 1920s and was eventually published by Stuart Gilbert in 1930 in his book, James Joyce’s “Ulysses”: A Study. Gilbert’s typed copy of the schema is housed in the Harley K. Croessmann Collection of James Joyce at Southern Illinois University Carbondale.

813	Mingyuan Ma	2	You've really reminded me how disorganized and in shambles my reading lists are right now. That's cool you have a good system. Any suggestions for finding good booklists? I'll have to check out Goodreads.Totally, it's after the movie or book that I want to know other people's thoughts and takeaways - once I have my own understanding and base to compare that knowledge and information with.Video games are almost the best medium to do this with, I've found. I'm not sure if you're much of a gamer, but I'll go ahead and say my bit anyway.... Because it's an actively engaging experience - as in you're not just letting the story wash over you - your inputs, ideas, and decisions will directly alter and affect the experience you have with the media and impact your experience heavier. The better the game, the more so (or completely) I will run it without looking at wikis, forums, or videos of it. Even for more mechanical based games: like survival, management, or strategy games; I prefer to go in blind (other than what's shown on the store page) because I'll still play those types of games with an rpg mindset and build a bit of a story and world in my mind as I go. And the failures I "achieve" and extra time wandering because of this add to my time spent. I'm not much of a min/maxer, I guess is what I'm saying, lol.
814	Mingyuan Ma	3	Morris's filter was, as Bossio says, his interpretation of trends. Because it was not a meta-analysis. So it's highly dependent on what Morris thinks and wants to use as sources.

818	Mingyuan Ma	2	/r/books is a default sub that contains discussions that crosses over with multiple other subs.  I mean if you saw someone discussing books would you tell them to post on /r/BookDiscussion ?
819	Mingyuan Ma	3	You can take a look at course descriptions for english courses on [this page][link] Many have booklists in the description, although not all of them do. The department publishes these every session. 
820	Mingyuan Ma	2	ive actually stopped using reddit for book talk, but if i remember correctly, /r/literature was good last I visited, /r/litdiscussion or was it /r/bookdiscussion something about discussion was also pretty good.
821	Mingyuan Ma	2	I'd say it's definitely low intensity. You can have OSRS open on a second monitor and focus 95% on a movie or tv show while just clicking the green boxes out of the corner of your eye.

824	Mingyuan Ma	1	Wonderful work on this! I've been looking forward to listening to this album for a while, and I really enjoyed doing so alongside your piece!1. I think relatively joyful? It has a lightness to it even though it deals with some heavier topics.2. I haven't listened to her previous work, sorry! I never knew she wrote *Crying in H-Mart* though lol.3. I do think it works cohesively, really quite well actually. Yes it explores but there's a tether that makes the songs feel connected as well. I really liked the sound on Posing for Cars-- that sort of dream-rock vibe really fits her I think.4. I think that her book must have helped, because even though I've yet to read it, it's showed up on so many booklists lately. Other than that I honestly have no idea how some artists achieve the levels of popularity they do.5. I loved Posing in Bondage and Posing for Cars. Those were both really beautiful!
825	Mingyuan Ma	1	Join a bookclub, awards/contests on wattpad so it gets visible for more people and you also receive feedback for your story and simultaneously connect with other writers!
826	Mingyuan Ma	2	I really like your advice on building your own syllabus - you give some pointers, but it's often difficult to do without an expert instructor. Do you have any further concrete advice? I give some in [my own comment][link], which basically boils down to three pieces of advice (1. look up other people's syllabi; 2. use anthologies, reader's guides, books on themes, introductory books, and books with good study questions; 3. read on the literary criticism and historical context around a particular work), but I'm interested if you'd like to expand further.
827	Mingyuan Ma	1	Piggybacking off your comment, could we please have a what to read if list as well for the more popular books that are recommended in this sub?
828	Mingyuan Ma	2	 Maybe try r/52book? I use Goodreads to set my reading goal for the year and track everything. Other than that, I make time to read every day. Usually at night before bed and on lunch breaks. More on the weekends. I read 81 books this year. I was thinking of trying for 100 but that might be a big stretch and I’m afraid I’d try to read only short books, which would limit the books I want to read that are long. I think maybe having a goal based on number of pages read would be neat too. I read less pages in 2021 than I did in 2020, despite that I read two books more in 2021 than I did the previous year.
829	Mingyuan Ma	1	This is the 52book most similar to my own! We read 12 of the same books in 2021 :)

847	Mingyuan Ma	2	Shameless plug of my answer to a similar question on r/AskLiteraryStudies a few weeks back:You might want to have a look at the late Mary Oliver's Poetry Handbook --- which I have read and liked --- or at The Making of a Poem: A Norton Anthology of Poetic Forms, edited by Mark Strand and Eavan Boland --- which I haven't read but would recommend solely based on my love for all things Norton!  If there were an English translation of Christoph Bode's Einführung in die Lyrikanalyse, I would tell you to disregard everything else and go for that one. Unfortunately, to my knowledge, only his introduction to prose writing has been translated as of yet (Christoph Bode - The Novel: An Introduction). Bode's books are some of the most enjoyable student's guides to literary studies I have come across.

851	Mingyuan Ma	3	My post is not a request for a "personalized" recommendation. It's not asking for a recommendation for one or more undetermined books based on criteria I list. It's a question of whether a specific book gets better.
852	Mingyuan Ma	3	I'm going to have to disagree with you. Honestly, I think this sub has a habit of hyping up James and Sirius when we don't know much about their intellect. All we really know is that they cast the Homunculus Charm (to create the Marauders Map), became Animagi along with Pettigrew, were sure they aced the DADA exam, and weren't studying in between exams. Honestly, unless Slughorn was just hyping Lily up, her talent seems a bit more impressive, although she doesn't have many actual achievements to back her.As for whether Hermione or James and Sirius were smarter, I think Hermione wins out. Even assuming that they weren't studying at all throughout their Hogwarts years and that they got top grades in all subjects (assertions with little to no canonical basis), Hermione's shown to learn insanely quick. IIRC, a week before they left for Hogwarts, they gathered their course books, but by the time they were on train, she was already months into the curriculum and practicing the Summoning Charm. And then a month or two after that, she learned fifth year-level material and was taking O.W.L practice tests. Not only that, but before her first year, she only had approximately 6 weeks to read her course books (since from CoS, we know students receive booklists for their corresponding year all at the same time), but by the time she met Harry and Ron on the train, she had them all memorized, along with tons of history books, and was casting simple spells on her first try (and they only learned their first charm in class on Halloween). I know that it's a bit counterintuitive to say that the girl who's always studying is a quicker learner than slackers who get similar scores, but I think people forget Hermione generally isn't focused on learning the basic material. It's frequently commented on in the books that when they're doing homework, Hermione takes piles of large books on the topic in areas they're not even touching on. Adding on the fact that she reads up on tons of subjects that the school doesn't cover (alchemy, dark magic, healing, protective enchantments, memory charms, etc.), it makes a lot of sense why she's constantly reading. The only time she's actually  studying the basic material is a few weeks before the exams, but, to me, that says more about her personality than her actual intellect. I used to be a slacker with top grades in every subject, but I knew one person who was always studying, and even though they got the same grades as me, it was obvious to me that they were much more naturally intelligent. Although that guy could have been a slacker and get the same grades, he was an anxious perfectionist, so his mindset led him to study much harder than the people who actually needed to study. The idea that slackers with top grades are always smarter than studiers with the same grades (even when the studier has better feats in terms of learning new material) is demonstrably false.
853	Mingyuan Ma	1	Congratulations!  So far, I'm having a great time, I hope you enjoy parenthood too.
854	Mingyuan Ma	1	I don't have 1000+ manga and I only buy small batches that I can reasonably read at a given time, so I mostly keep track in my head. I do record it on the goodreads app when I finish reading something (gotta meet my yearly), but not when I just buy something. There have been a few times when I've forgotten which books I have in a series, but that's always been because I haven't read all that I have for that series, which is a sign that I lost interest and don't need to buy more of it at this time.I feel like the people who lose track and double buy books are usually the compulsive spenders who just buy 50+ book hauls to have and not to read. Usually when I place orders (or plan out my shopping list for in person buying), I am at home and can reference my collection for any books I am unsure about.  If someone just has trouble with detail and attention with remembering their collections, there are apps like goodreads and a few others (I don't  know them, but have seen them mentioned in this subreddit) they can use when they are out and about or just for quick reference before they hit the checkout screen to keep track.
855	Mingyuan Ma	2	I know that you're specifically asking for the opinion of a _historian_, but your question lies at the intersection of literature and history. An academic trained in language and literature might find some parts of your question easier to weigh in on with authority. You might benefit from posing this to r/AskLiteraryStudies, too.
856	Mingyuan Ma	2	I use a combination of Excel and Goodreads.
857	Mingyuan Ma	1	yeah i mean idk why advertise using stickers if the stickers dont actually give any reference for where or when the “bookclub” takes place :|
858	Mingyuan Ma	1	Late to the party this week, my daughter was sick and we ended up having to go to the hospital Saturday night so my weekend was practically book free. Add in the fact that I wasn't really enjoying the audiobook I'd been listening to and just a general reading slump and I only finished one book this past week.The audiobook, **Tell me an Ending** was, similar to Parzival pretty disappointing. I provided some word-vomit thoughts [here][link], but in summary the book felt like a slog, the characters were boring and the blurb was misleading. 
859	Mingyuan Ma	1	Not going to entertain any request to educate people on what racism is or point out specific examples of racism. You guys can go down internet rabbit holes and find any information you need about anything. Why suddenly whenever it comes to race, you forget that skill and need handholding?
860	Mingyuan Ma	1	I think it's weirder than that. I feel like there are some incredibly persuasive women out there managing to get money from a rich guy without giving up their bodies. As in, a little flirtation, but mostly companionship.
861	Mingyuan Ma	2	There's [A Different Sort of Normal][link] by Abigail Balfe. It's a heavily illustrated memoir. It's aimed at the middle-grade level (BookTrust suggests age 9+), but I remember being a five-year-old reading way above my nominal level, so I'm not about to gatekeep! :-) It talks about autism, and about what it's like growing up autistic (without knowing that's what you're doing). It might not be quite what you're after, but do take a look; even if you decide it's not right for your son, you might well enjoy it yourself.Bonus: Reading to the end of that article, I discovered that BookTrust have an ["Autism" list][link]: children's and YA books featuring characters on the autistic spectrum. I haven't read them so don't know if any of them would suit, but hopefully someone else here will, or you'll be able to find helpful reviews somewhere.

863	Mingyuan Ma	1	YTA. I had to go back and reread the ages because I thought for sure you were 17 given how silly the fight you started was. He was not talking to you he was talking to someone else on the phone. Stop acting like a child. The world does not revolve around you. If your boyfriend wants to talk about the movie with someone else he can. You just need to butt out of a conversation you were not involved or invited into. No one asked your opinion or involved you in any way so why exactly do you have a right to be mad here?
864	Mingyuan Ma	3	Welcome to /r/ExplainAFilmPlotBadly. In order to ensure that everyone has read the rules and mods can stop removing posts that break them, we are requiring additional approvals for new users before their posts will show up in the subreddit.
865	Mingyuan Ma	1	I’ve just started reading along M with r/bookclub this month - really enjoying it so far. Tend to read around 4-6 books a month, with check ins every week or so to discuss.
866	Mingyuan Ma	2	Check out the weekly suggestions thread(should be stickied), the mod recommendation in the sidebar, /r/booksuggestions , or  /r/whattoreadwhen
867	Mingyuan Ma	1	Have you asked this question from a previous account, or has there been a glitch in the matrix?
868	Mingyuan Ma	2	The subreddit is titled ‘AskLiteraryStudies’.That’s what the OP did. If you want, start a subreddit called ‘Don’tAskResearchQuestionsYouCouldGoogle’. Your indignation when confronted with a similar polite request will then be appropriate.
869	Mingyuan Ma	3	No, but you need to offer more than just a book list to get the discussion going. No low quality book lists. To maintain quality, the list must encourage discussion. For linked lists the list itself must have descriptive paragraphs for each book. Users are also encouraged to submit their own unique lists as a self/text-post. Original lists should have at least a paragraph explaining the reason for the list and include some further thoughts on at least a few of the books. The poster must have actually read each book. Alternatively, there is /r/booklists.If you are just curious about others' answers the question has been asked in the past and you can find those threads by using the search.
870	Mingyuan Ma	1	We are reading this over at r/bookclub. You should come check out the discussions. We read to Chapter IX this week. I hope you like the book. It took me a few chapters to get into it, but now I am really digging the characters and the world :)
871	Mingyuan Ma	3	Please edit your post to hide those book spoilers. Thanks.
872	Mingyuan Ma	2	Nice job!! You may want to check out r/52book, they share a lot of content like this.
873	Mingyuan Ma	2	Work on your readers’ advisory (RA)! You can create booklists based on authors, subjects, moods, read alikes (for books and also for tv/movies), or so many other things. For books you’re not actually interested in reading, you can [read a book in 5 minutes][link]
874	Mingyuan Ma	1	A big yes on this one! Quality, age appropriate historical fiction will do wonders in all these areas! Make sure they are interesting, not dry. There are booklists to help you on the web. Let him enjoy reading alone and together. You can include your kindergartener as well - older can read to the younger, vice versa as the younger gets older,  and you can read to both. Fun unit studies and comprehension activities can be built around them. You will look back at this precious family time with fondness and have built strong reading/writing skills in your children.
875	Mingyuan Ma	1	Congrats on the new Job! Also finding your content and hearing about bookclub and everyone posting memes really brought out a lot of good laughs I had even though it was just through the internet lol, Hopefully more content comes soon. &lt;3
876	Mingyuan Ma	2	I forgot to mention the local group responsible that i referred to has national funding from conservative groups and is of course also fighting CRT and LGBQI and anti-mask anti-vax issues in every form. They are so coordinated they actually have a volunteer program for "how to get books removed from libraires" where they have PowerPoints, booklists, and local chapter meetings. The trainings include enlisting children to check out every book on the list from libraries and then just not returning them (or just stealing them, as long as you're righteous in doing so), how to personally harrass board members and librarians, demand librarians be fired, instructs them to go to board meetings and read out of context paragraphs from books to illicit outrage, tells them they should avoid reading the books themselves because they are too disturbing ("trust us, we've read them all") coaches them on verbiage like to make sure to not say the word "banned" but use other synonyms in its place, to use words like "pornography" in order to quote public pornography laws, as if that is applicable, and my personal favorite- call the police. They literally put out a press release instructing their 20k followers to locate these books in libraries, and call police and file police reports for pornography and public indecency. 
877	Mingyuan Ma	3	In the Skin of a Jihadist: A Young Journalist Enters the Isis Recruit Network, by Anna Erelle** is an amazing story of a Muslim journalist who went undercover posing as a USA Muslim Girl to a member of IsIs. She was trying to gain information about how they were recruiting youth in order to help an organization that intervenes in deradicalizing youth. She was unknowingly being tapped by the NSA, and the information they gained from her was used to take out a high ranking member. It’s an amazing story.
878	Mingyuan Ma	2	I enjoy looking at r/52book to see what people are reading.Somewhere in the sidebar menu or wiki of r/books there is a list of book subreddits.
879	Mingyuan Ma	3	This got touched on a little in [this recent discussion] [link], with some examples.
880	Mingyuan Ma	1	"I thought I told you I didn't want to hear about that movie" Do you hear yourself? "Is that really controlling?" Omg smh 🙄😒
881	Mingyuan Ma	2	Join us in r/52book!  You can technically have any goal though.
882	Mingyuan Ma	2	A wild ride stuffed to the cut-lines with humor, heart, and space shenanigans.May’s humdrum life gets flung into hyperdrive when she’s abducted, but not all aliens are out to probe her. She’s inadvertently rescued by Xan who’s been orbiting Earth in a day-glo orange rocket ship, watching re-runs of “I Love Lucy”. Seizing the opportunity for a better life, May learns how to race the Audacity and pilots her way into interstellar infamy. Finally, she has a job she likes and a friend to share her winnings with—until the Goddess of Chaos screws the whole thing up, and Xan’s unmentionable past makes a booty call.
883	Mingyuan Ma	2	Join us over at r/52book!
884	Mingyuan Ma	3	I would check the 1859 letter (essay) on art.  It's written as if it were a letter convincing a Salon to search for a certain type of artist.  I would not wager my life on it, and i'm not going to go through the letter in French to find it for a person, because it's 100 pages and my French is intermediate.In general, Baudelaire took this from Kant.  Romantics he cites that I can remember are mostly Kant and Emerson.That said, this could be one of the earlier letters, I think 1854 or 1855 are the way the other two are remembered, because later in his life Baudelaire seemed less eager to call himself or people he admired romantics and started focusing on decadence more explicitly.Honestly, this one quote is basically restated in several different parts of his critical work.  You may be able to find a look-a-like quote that does say what you've said exactly but that focuses on the impression or senses rather than the object.That the word "modern" is used explicitly makes me also think that this comes from the 1859 letter.  You may have better luck in r/AskLiteraryStudies .
885	Mingyuan Ma	1	A Christmas Carol, Crime and Punishment. Look for books with redemption arches.  Found you this thread - https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/36ki6d/who_are_some_of_the_most_well_known_heroes_who/
886	Mingyuan Ma	1	This is so awesome, is it from a Fritz Lang movie?
887	Mingyuan Ma	3	Yes, however you are right, you should probably educate yourself because if you go in without the education that is for sure when your ignorance (not to be mean or anything, just stating that's how it is since you don't have the exposure) would detract from the progresses being made in spaces of activism, read up on the history (it will help you understand everything better including your racial identity) and anti-racism. There are a ton of booklists and recommendations that come up when you look for one or two on Goodreads and Amazon. If you want even, I'm pretty sure you could get the audio books for them.
888	Mingyuan Ma	1	This gets me too. I've slowly started dwindling out of the WDYR posts because of how annoying it is to see the post information for that week be something like "DNF after 2 pages into sample because ....." I know I DNF anytime but it's not a weekly recurrence to DNF every single book, most of the time in the sample downloaded first chapters. Recently there was one where the only book tried and DNF was the FF Bookclub pick of the month. Could you not bring negative publicity to 1. a queer (f/nb) romance that already has a slim chance of getting recognition 2. a book you didn't read and 3. have it as the image that pops up on the most frequented post as a DNF associated with not being good.Just having someone else post that WDYR recurring post would be fantastic. Other mods are definitely reading and can actually contribute to the conversations. .... sorry, apparently i'm passionate about the picky WDYR posts lol.
889	Mingyuan Ma	1	I'm gonna say for newreadersAvengers by BuisiekAvengers by BendisAvengers by Aaron
890	Mingyuan Ma	2	Exactly what I'm talking about. Every nation has to a certain degree a bias towards itself.I can't watch most war movies from the US as they are full of patriotism. The Vietnam movies are generally better in that regard, as the war was always seen very critically but I literally can't think of WWII movie where the soldiers are shown in a bad light. The worst thing I remember seeing is them killing POWs (but as they are Wehrmacht soldiers, who cares?) but I can't even think of one movie where a soldier rapes a woman of a liberated town or something similar atrocious.
891	Mingyuan Ma	2	Booklists, my favorite thing to share! I've been jotting titles down as they came to me.  Standing trigger warning for these, as everything RBB-relatable that has the potential to give solace also has the potential to trigger, a couple have SA content handled with sensitivity.. *Fiction* isa Tuttle, The Silver Bough Maggie O'Farrell, Hamnet T.H. White's The Once and Future King, especially The Queen of Air and Darkness Jude Morgan, PassionSusan Palwick, Shelter, Flying in Place Angela Carter, The Magic Toyshop Ursula LeGuin, GiftsGoodnight Mr Tom, Michelle Magorian Elizabeth Wein, The Winter Prince and the rest of her Lionhunters series. Maureen McHugh, Mothers and Other Monsters--worth it for the title alone :p--and all the rest of her her excellent novels. ...and Diana Wynne Jones.  Pretty much everything she wrote explores RBB themes and characters through the prism of story.
892	Mingyuan Ma	3	To get revenge on King Mildred, Grizelda creates the fiercest dragon the kingdom has ever seen.  He is such a terror that he must be killed. Now if only the dragonslayers could stop arguing long enough to face the greatest battle of all!
893	Mingyuan Ma	1	100 percent agree. I see the same garbage from some people talking about NADPOD and I’m pretty sure I even saw it once in a conversation about her old podcast 8 bit bookclub. It’s gross.
894	Mingyuan Ma	1	Married, no kids(childfree by choice), weirdo, child at heart, goofball to boot, lover of animals, sarcasm is something I'm fluent in, and gosh dang I love a good adventure
895	Mingyuan Ma	3	Not something I've heard about or have got an impression of. The BBC does not only use RP speakers these days, but the newreaders they do use tend to eliminate anything that might be considered a regionalism but maintain their native phonemic realisation for the most part. It could well be possible that you heard a newsreader who wasn't even from the South of England, perhaps the Midlands, but didn't stand out as such due to the toned down nature of the regional accents the BBC allows. It's not uncommon for middle class speakers in the Midlands and even the North to sound little different from middle class southerners bar lacking some of the more pronounced features like the trap-bath split, extensive diphthong smoothing, and more extensive use of schwa. This is particularly true of the generation who grew up at a time when regional accents were frowned upon by the middle class to a greater degree.Historically, the geographic region where the trap-bath split is prevalent has already shrunk. It used to encompass much of the Midlands including Birmingham, but merged over time during the 20th century most likely due to the class association.
896	Mingyuan Ma	1	While many of my favourites are already mentioned (Gunnerkrigg Court, Wilde Life, Kill Six Billion Demons, Homestuck) i haven't seen [Monster Pulse](https://www.monster-pulse.com/newreaders) here yet. By Mangolia Porter Siddell it tells the story of kids whose organs get turned into monsters due to a secret project, and how that affects their lives. The art constantly evolves, the characterisations are great, there is good character drama and action, it goes some messed up places and doesn't shy away from some serious consequences from the premise and it regularly updates! Close to being finished even! I can only reccommend it.
897	Mingyuan Ma	3	Civility is one our rules, please be sure to keep that in mind with all comments and posts. Insulting people isn't in line with that rule.
898	Mingyuan Ma	2	I’m just calling it a buddy read for lack of a better term— I was a teacher and that’s what it was called when you’d pair two readers to tackle a book together. I’m kind of hoping that as we go along this year we’ll find other people who will feel like joining us so I’m fine with not setting too much in stone. For me it would be ideal though if we can have a few (three- five) titles planned in advance because I’ll be doing other reading besides what we’re doing together and that will help with my time management. What if you just make a post about Emma here in r/52book whenever you’ve finished it and tag me in the comments? I’ll have it read by Saturday night. 
899	Mingyuan Ma	2	Hi, it looks like you're trying to summon u/goodreads-bot. Unfortunately, they don't play nicely with me or the r/Fantasy Golem family, so they're not welcome here. Please resubmit your comment.
900	Mingyuan Ma	2	Setting a goal and posting my progress on r/52book has helped me stay on track. I wanted to read more the year before but this has provided more accountability for me.
901	Mingyuan Ma	3	Please post lists of books in /r/booklists.
902	Mingyuan Ma	3	Audra Simpson's *Mohawk Interruptus*You might also want to ask over at /r/AskLiteraryStudies too.

905	Mingyuan Ma	2	Last year I read 55 books and probably 15-20 I got from this sub or from books posted on r/52book. Thank you everyone.
906	Mingyuan Ma	1	as someone who works at a place like this: dont leave it to the last week before school goes back. booklists are sent out november/early december. unless you are new to the state or changing school with little notice, be prepared. if you order early, we will have stock, we will have it sent out on time (or if you shop in store there will not be long waits), and you will be happy. and ESPECIALLY do not be one of those people that orders late, doesnt get their stuff in time for start of term and decides to call customer service to abuse the poor high school aged kids old on the phones working hard their summer holiday.
907	Mingyuan Ma	3	The descending numbers on the left tell you what printing the book is. You have a seventh and a tenth printing shown. If the number line is something like 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1, it's a first printing, 10 9 8 7 6 5 is a fifth printing etc (the number at the beginning doesn't matter). For book collectors, first printings can be highly collectible and for some books, much more valuable than later printings. The reason for this is a first printing run usually doesn't print as many books as later printing runs (because the publisher doesn't necessarily know how popular the book will be), and, because the first printing shows the book text and other features exactly as they originally were when the book was first printed. Later printings may fix mistakes or change things slightly. In addition, if you are interested in the ads at the back of the book, the first printing will show the "current" ads to when the book was published, while later printings show ads from potentially years later. Sometimes you'll also find out interesting trivia from first or earlier printings - for instance, the booklists in the back of the book include titles of upcoming books, and sometimes those titles change when the book is actually published. For instance, 'Werewolf Skin' was originally called 'I want to be a werewolf for Halloween' and you can still see this original title in some of the booklists and/or ads in book #59.For your purposes, there's no important difference between a seventh and a tenth printing, in terms of collectible value or anything else. For some of the earlier Goosebumps books, like books #1-6 where first printings are rare, the first printings might be worth slightly more than others but most Goosebumps collectors don't care, they just want an original series 90s book rather than a reprint. I did sell a first printing of #4 for $20 once, so maybe a few people care. Although, in my experience, usually the first printing is pretty much the same as the second - fifth printing, but if you compared a first printing to a 20th printing, there would be different ads, different booklists, different or no cover ads, etc. (note that for later books, like 50s and 60s, it's almost rarer to find a book that isn't a first printing than one that is, because the later books didn't get many printing runs.)It's also through knowing about first printings that I was able to figure out exactly what month certain publishing changes occurred. You may notice that some Goosebumps books have the ISBN/price on the cover, and some don't. The ISBN/price stopped appearing on the cover starting in November 1995. Any Goosebumps book, including later printings of earlier books, published this month and after doesn't have it. I know this because I have owned first printings of both #36 and #37 (first published in October 1995 and November 1995, respectively) and #36 had it while #37 didn't.
908	Mingyuan Ma	3	Did you happen to check out our rules before posting? Both of your questions are answered there. No low quality book lists. To maintain quality, the list must encourage discussion. For linked lists the list itself must have descriptive paragraphs for each book. Users are also encouraged to submit their own unique lists as a self/text-post. Original lists should have at least a paragraph explaining the reason for the list and include some further thoughts on at least a few of the books. The poster must have actually read each book. Alternatively, there is /r/booklists.
909	Mingyuan Ma	3	r/booklists can be a choice.
910	Mingyuan Ma	3	Once in a great while, we encounter a novel in our voluminous reading that begs to be read aloud. Leif Enger's debut, Peace Like a River, is one such work. His richly evocative novel, narrated by an asthmatic 11-year-old named Reuben Land, is the story of Reuben's unusual family and their journey across the frozen Badlands of the Dakotas in search of his fugitive older brother. Charged with the murder of two locals who terrorized their family, Davy has fled, understanding that the scales of justice will not weigh in his favor. But Reuben, his father, Jeremiah—a man of faith so deep he has been known to produce miracles—and Reuben's little sister, Swede, follow closely behind the fleeing Davy.
911	Mingyuan Ma	1	i can see how that would parcially fit, but not really... I'm looking for a subreddit where they deliberately rate books based on writing technique and plot, and while i imagine r/AskLiteraryStudies would rate that, i would guess people dont usually post there with that in mind... Just more of a on-demand thing
912	Mingyuan Ma	2	I think you'd be better off asking this question in either r/AskLiteraryStudies or r/TrueLit .
913	Mingyuan Ma	2	It was one of the only bookclub books I could get my hands on this month. And I was kind of middling going in, but I really ended up enjoying it.
914	Mingyuan Ma	1	I like the subreddits r/whattoreadwhen and r/books for potential leads into new series and to keep a thumb on the pulse as they say, to what people are enjoying.
915	Mingyuan Ma	1	Does anyone have recommendations for books with elderly main characters? I've seen a few booklists here with middle-aged characters, but I wonder if there are any with characters older than that, grandparents or retirees.
916	Mingyuan Ma	2	Posts asking users to list their favorite/the best book of a genre, style, etc that don't **include an answer and why in the body** will be assumed to be recommendation requests and removed. 'Should I read X book?' and 'What do I need to know before I read X' posts are not allowed unless you have made an effort to encourage discussion, otherwise you might be re-directed to the Weekly Recommendation Thread or [/r/suggestmeabook](https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook).
917	Mingyuan Ma	1	Hahah we read it for my last bookclub, and I was “hate-reading” it by the end. I was so annoyed with it but also had to finish. I didn’t really like any of the characters and I felt like we were rushing through all the husbands without any character development. Waste of 6 hours of my life 😩
918	Mingyuan Ma	3	No.  You're best off taking this to /r/AskLiteraryStudies.
919	Mingyuan Ma	1	When I was a wee lad, all the school booklists were submitted to the school and we picked it up from school. Is this a thing of the past and up to the parents/guardians to chase up before the year starts nowadays?(Don't have my own kids, left school in 1987, I have no idea how things work in regards to schools and schooling)
920	Mingyuan Ma	1	Definitely! Mostly on /r/52book - sometimes a cover catches my eye and makes me want to read it.I still will look up things about the book to confirm it doesn't have content I don't want to read (erotica, etc). But the cover got me interested.
921	Mingyuan Ma	3	/r/books is the general sub, there are plenty of more specific subs if you want something specific* /r/bookbinding* /r/bookcaseporn[link]
922	Mingyuan Ma	1	I get paying an escort. They will leave when you're done, and you don't need to pretend any sort of connection. Sugar Babies are... More insidious. It's like they want the money, but aren't willing to do nearly as much. I get it from their pov, but what are the rich men getting out of it?
923	Mingyuan Ma	1	Yep. Looks like your post violates this rule of that subreddit: Recommendation Requests
924	Mingyuan Ma	4	Usually just reading, reading about what's going on, reading people's thoughts, theories, visions, reading people's diaries, reading all about others, one could say I like reading what other people's shoes are walking about like. Lots of times picking up a conversation, maybe a friend, and sending random acts of cards and r/52book is where I say mostly.
925	Mingyuan Ma	2	Maybe /r/bookdiscussion? A place to discuss books you are currently reading, have recently finished, or would like to talk about in general.Seems low activity, but they have a Discord that might be more active.
926	Mingyuan Ma	1	Girl who do you think you are? If he choose to speak with somebody else about the movie it's nine of your business. He respected what you ask and not had a long conversation WITH YOU. He's a grown man and you really spoke yo him like he's a high school boy. Your definitely TA I can guarantee if he stop going to the movies with you all together you would swear it's an issue. You need to apologize that was so ignorant
927	Mingyuan Ma	1	(Psst this IS the /52book sub!)
928	Mingyuan Ma	1	Hi there. Per [rule 3.3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Books/wiki/rules), please post book recommendation requests in /r/SuggestMeABook or in our Weekly Recommendation Thread. Thank you!
929	Mingyuan Ma	1	Yes!! It’s called ‘Goodreads’, you can track your reading, review books and make booklists, similar to Spotify but with books
930	Mingyuan Ma	2	The whole Krakoa business seemed to make many characters less religuous in favour of whatever mutant religion Nightcrawler is founding.Which I find somewhat sad. An interfaith religious bookclub on Krakoa would have been fun. People sitting around and discussing how ressurections change their world view.
931	Mingyuan Ma	3	I do about 1-2 a week usually. So far I’ve read1. *Samurai* by Michael Wert (nonfiction)2. *The Souls of Black Folk* by WEB Dubois (nonfiction)3. *How Few Remain* by Harry Turtledove (fiction)4. *The Thousand Crimes of Ming Tsu* by Tom Lin (fiction)5. *Shadow Divers* by Robert Kurson (nonfiction)*Thousand Crimes* was a western and it was also really good, so probably my favorite fiction book this year.You should check out /r/52book, it’s a challenge to read at least 1 book a week for a year
932	Mingyuan Ma	3	The Christmas season offers little cheer for Eileen Dunlop, an unassuming yet disturbed young woman trapped between her role as her alcoholic father’s caretaker in a home whose squalor is the talk of the neighborhood and a day job as a secretary at the boys prison, filled with its own quotidian horrors. Consumed by resentment and self-loathing, Eileen tempers her dreary days with perverse fantasies and dreams of escaping to the big city. In the meantime, she fills her nights and weekends with shoplifting, stalking a buff prison guard named Randy, and cleaning up her increasingly deranged father’s messes. When the bright, beautiful, and cheery Rebecca Saint John arrives on the scene as the new counselor at the prison, Eileen is enchanted and proves unable to resist what appears at first to be a miraculously budding friendship. But her affection for Rebecca ultimately pulls her into complicity in a crime that surpasses her wildest imaginings.
933	Mingyuan Ma	3	I read a decent amount of philosophy and academic nonfiction. Philosophy is deceptive, quite a lot of it is dense but on the shorter end 150 pages. Both have a high barrier to entry that becomes easier over time. I just finished rereading Dune last week. If you want some ideas of the books I've read, I will post pictures of them to 52book which you can get from my profile. You can also see what kinds of books I'm doing for this year's challenge and my reviews for them.
934	Mingyuan Ma	1	Ah, thanks! I reposted it here: [link]
935	Mingyuan Ma	1	This argument has been tossed around a few times over at r/52book and similar book related subs.Technically you didn't read it, but you're not going to get knocked for hearing it instead. Audiobooks are acceptable ways to experience a book, and "yes" is an acceptable answer if someone asked if you've read a book. That said, I when someone asks me if I've read a book, and I listened to the audiobook, I'll just answer something like "I heard the audiobook". But it will still count towards my "reading list".One thing that I am peculiar about, is that the experience of an audiobook is sub-par for gripping stories. When you learn to read without an internal monologue, things become more vivid. Similar to seeing a stop sign and knowing to "stop" without having to vocalize the word, reading a book offers a similar experience where you blaze by the words and your mind races with images that come to life.
936	Mingyuan Ma	2	That's nice but still a lot of those are not "general". Thanks for trying I'm going to go through them. /bookdiscussion has been taken over by a spammer. 
937	Mingyuan Ma	1	This is my first year doing the challenge after discovering it, and pairing it with the popsugar prompts has been a fun step outsider what I may usually do. Also I’m trying to train myself that when I’m scrolling Reddit at night if I see a post from /r/books or /r/52book it is time to put down the phone and pick up the kindle.
938	Mingyuan Ma	3	What made this book unique from it’s predecessors is that shortly before it’s release, Martin announced that while working on the book he has reached over 1500 pages and still the book remains unfinished.
939	Mingyuan Ma	1	You should check out r/52book. I am only 8 books in, but am still on track.
940	Mingyuan Ma	1	If "cite-checking" is some kind of jargon that refers to the entire [literature review][link] process, well, *excuse me* for not knowing the jargon -- but *don't* mistake not knowing the jargon for not understanding the process!You may "(a) know just enough to be dangerous about how legislation is made, and (b) am used to dealing with similar levels of complexity" but you clearly don't know what you don't know.Do you realize how fundamentally condescending and hypocritical that sort of attitude is? Apparently, I was wrong before: you *do* mean it that way!
941	Mingyuan Ma	3	It is a cult: „those man made scripts are gods word even if there is no proof whatsoever and if you don’t join my bookclub and continue being who you are (how my god made you essentially?) my loving and merciful god will send you to hell where you will be tortured forever“ The world would be much better off if people would just worship nature instead, but well, this planet and humanity is the way it is unfortunately.
942	Mingyuan Ma	1	Here’s one where you do know what’s going on, but nonetheless … From another reviewer on Goodreads re David Weber’s alien invasion novel *Out of The Dark*:  Up to this point I’d give the novel two out of five stars, maybe two and a half if you like David Weber or military sci-fi. On page 330 a crime is committed against narrative justice and the book drops to below one star. I would break out negative stars for this thing if I could. What is this crime, you ask? Well, on page 330 of a 380 page novel, vampires arrive and kill all the aliens.No, I am not kidding.
943	Mingyuan Ma	1	Unless they are somehow associated with one another,but that's crazy talk,nothing at all like that has,or ever will happen! They are from different states you say? I was gonna say maybe they were all in the same bookclub or knitting circle,but to have associations across state lines is nearly impossible! Jeez,You must be right then,congratulations.

944	Mingyuan Ma	3	No. I would consider nihilism a state where truth, values, or human purpose is pointless. RDR 2 (the game I have familiarity with; you don't get to pick and choose in r/AskLiteraryStudies) doesn't fit that.Red Dead Redemption 2 would arguably be more existentialist, in the sense that it gives players choices for how to conduct themselves, for how to find purpose and meaning. For instance, you appeal to what you **can** do in the game, but you neglect to address player choice. Players can abstain from murder, robbery, or shooting while free roaming. Players can go entirely pacifist or choose to only defend themselves when attacked. Players can apply their own codes of ethics for how they engage. So it's up to a player whether they want to play as a nihilist. RDR 2 is also arguably more structured than that. Even in free roam, there is a slider (admittedly simple) keeping track of how good or bad Arthur has been, suggesting an objective basis of ethics - the game allows players to do bad but would not let them get away with too much bad, ultimately. Also, story missions are scripted in a way that defines a kind of ethics surrounding the actions of Arthur, Dutch, and the other characters. That they sometimes do cruel things, even in the story, does not mean that values or truth are absent. Indeed, the arc of the story does a pretty good job in putting (for instance) Dutch in his place.So unless someone had a more specific definition of nihilism and a tighter argument for applying it to RDR2, I wouldn't call that game nihilistic.
945	Mingyuan Ma	3	Here are some really good books that I've used over the years:Judika Illes' "Encyclopedia of 5000 Spells."Jason Augustus Newcomb's "The Book of Magick Power."Jason Miller's "The Sorcerer's Secrets."Bill Whitcomb's "The Magician's Reflection" (an excellent handbook for building one's own set of magical correspondences in a meaningful way.)Kenaz Filan &amp; Raven Kaldera's ""Talking to the Spirits" and "Drawing Down the Spirits".Frater U.D.'s "High Magic" and "High Magic II" for a comprehensive training program in magic.I've put together some lists of the better books on specific witchy topics, like working with herbs, protection magic, working with magic energy, etc. over at my own website if anyone is looking for more suggestions: [link]

It was named for the bridge of boats, or zeugma, that crossed the Euphrates river at that location.

952	Mingyuan Ma	1	I'm not trying to determine what can or can't be posted, but /r/ebooks or /r/books or one of the sub-genre threads would probably be better for discussion. You could also consider /r/bookdiscussion and /r/bookrecommendationsIMO, the post still seems like promo though. 
953	Mingyuan Ma	2	If it isn't relevant to the sub, don't post it in the sub.  Go to /r/books, or /r/bookdiscussion.  Doesn't make any sense to know you're posting in the wrong place and do it anyway.
954	Mingyuan Ma	1	My daughter is in 4th grade (9 years old) and she just took her yearly Lexile test (I'm not sure what the test itself is called) and she got a score  range of 1070-1200 which is and 8th-9th grade reading level if I'm reading all the info correctly. Anyway her teacher asked for help finding books in her range so I thought I'd ask on here too. I think maybe non-fiction would be a good change but I have no idea where to even start with that. She loves fantasy fiction but I'm concerned with the content she may start encountering as she moves up into those higher levels. Thanks for your help!!
955	Mingyuan Ma	3	This is the first of three fascinating volumes in which Braudel, the renowned historian and celebrated author of The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World, offers what is in effect an economic and social history of the world from the Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution. Like everything he writes, it is new, stimulating and sparkles like champagne.Braudel's technique, it has been said, is that of a pointilliste. Myriads of separate details, sharp glimpses of reality experienced by real people, are seen miraculously to orchestrate themselves into broad rhythms that underlie and transcend the excitements and struggles of particular periods. Braudel sees the past as we see the present — only in a longer perspective and over a wider field.The perspective is that of the possible, of the actual material limitations to human life in any given time or place. It is the every¬day, the habitual — the obvious that is so obvious it has hitherto been neglected by historians — that Braudel claims for a new and vast and enriching province of history. Food and drink, dress and housing, demography and family structure, energy and technology, money and credit, and, above all, the growth of towns, that powerful agent of social and economic development, are described in all the richness and complexity of real life.[link]

958	Mingyuan Ma	1	Read and join or start a bookclub. I totally enjoy the experience of reading a book and discussing it with people from all walks of life afterwards.I don't know how well your relationship with your parents is but you could definitely use the time to connect with them too, maybe even suggest doing activities as a family? :)
959	Mingyuan Ma	1	I understand where you're coming from. Sorry if I reacted a little miffed.I did believe that format by itself would inspire a bit of discussion, even though I was deliberately not expressing a point of view. The less-frequent words in a book exemplify so much of what's extraordinary about a book. They encapsulate the time (in the evolution of the English language), the place, the narrator's rank, the themes... and the treasury of language at large. I thought it was much more interesting to just put it out there and let people react without guidance, than to explain it like a schoolmaster and then let people say: Yes/No/Yes but/No but... I'd find that a little tedious. But, as you've said, if r/books is really r/bookdiscussion than maybe my post wasn't appropriate. Save travels.
960	Mingyuan Ma	2	There's a wide breadth of subject knowledge as well as depth. I need to be an expert in adolescent development, our community, collection management, and project management, among other things. The masters has been very helpful in teaching me how to analyze data to make wise decisions for my community.
961	Mingyuan Ma	3	Have a search and ask around at r/AskLiteraryStudies.
962	Mingyuan Ma	3	Poor Dionis or Poor Dionysus (Romanian: Sărmanul Dionis, originally spelled Sermanul Dionisie; also translated as Wretched Dionysus or The Sorrowful Dionis) is an 1872 prose work by Romanian poet Mihai Eminescu, classified by scholars as either a novel, a novella or a modern fairy tale. It is a liberal interpretation of contemporary German philosophy and ancient motifs, discussing themes such as time travel and reincarnation through the lens of post-Kantian idealism.
963	Mingyuan Ma	2	Like u/roranicusrex, I have a similar reading pattern where I catch up on weekends if I can’t read much through the workweek. I use physical, ebook, and audiobooks, sometimes switching formats for the same book so I can keep “reading” while I’m driving or doing chores at home. (Scribd and the public library are godsends for that). I joined r/52book - a book a week - during the pandemic and dramatically improved my book count from a pathetic 8 in 2019 to 65 in 2020 and I pledge never to go back! It’s the right pastime for me.
964	Mingyuan Ma	3	[link]TPL offers books about Toronto sorted by neighborhood
965	Mingyuan Ma	1	I'm not sure if you were looking for suggestions or for sources but I like the Read Aloud Revival.  She has all kinds of lists of books for different ages, interests, etc.  She does make some gender assumptions so don't be afraid to check out lists for either gender (my son loved the secret garden and little house books, but my daughter wasn't a fan.). I started with my father's dragon with both kids and they loved it
966	Mingyuan Ma	2	1. What specific details are you looking for that you couldn’t find yourself by knowing which curriculum is used? Knowing which curriculum is used would allow you to look at the curriculum website, see examples, booklists, materials, summaries, and you could view the textbooks and teachers manuals by asking at the school. Which “level of detail” are you looking for that wouldn’t be covered by this? To be honest, your dismissal of the importance of which specific curriculum is used doesn’t back up your claims that you have gone through this process yourself. The only additional “level of details” you could get is access to the individually created lesson plans of each teacher, classroom decorations/posters, read aloud books, differentiated worksheets, etc, and it would be ridiculously burdensome and unmanageable and damaging to education to try to require these in advance.2. You claim you sought out information regarding the curriculum at your local district Can you provide the name of the curriculum you disapproved of to back up your claim? Can you explain, specifically, what was in it that you disapproved of?
967	Mingyuan Ma	1	Depends on the season and what players I'm excited about at the moment but I enjoy hanging on r/tennis when they're not being toxic. 😶 I used to visit books but had the same issue as you. Now I'm subbed to r/52book which is less active but gives me some good ideas about what I may want to check out.
968	Mingyuan Ma	3	The same happened with the Scots wiki. Decent enough sentences were posted on Twitter and mocked because words like 'muckle' and 'ken' were unfamiliar to them. How can a language thrive when many of the people to whom it's meant to belong have nothing but embarrassment over it?
969	Mingyuan Ma	3	If this doesn't make sense, please reply with more than a one-word question so I have a better idea of what is confusing you about this.

972	Mingyuan Ma	3	Lots of combinations are possible. Usually a solid unlimited server on one backbone and a block on another backbone is good enough. Or 2 unlimited servers on different backbones. Speed should always be as fast as the server allows for (unlike torrents) however that fluctuates sometimes depending on your server and what you are downloading (age usually). You will need a good indexer as well but there are many that are free for limited downloads per day. Maybe try out the free ones and then decide which one you like best/want to pay for.
973	Mingyuan Ma	1	downvote this comment if the meme sucks. upvote it and I'll go away.
974	Mingyuan Ma	3	Bakhtin is pretty much the founder of modern literary criticism so I came across him pretty early. I recommend you read a literary theory introduction (there are some pretty good ones by Terry Eagleton, which is my favourite, and Peter Barry) and check out their bibliographies. You could also lurk around /r/AskLiteraryStudies, they have threads about this all the time
975	Mingyuan Ma	1	There's a subreddit called /r/whattoreadwhen that does this for books. /r/whattolistentowhen and /r/whattowatchwhen also exist, but are both dead, I'm not aware of any live versions.

978	Mingyuan Ma	1	Love it! I rarely see it on booklists, though and I don't know why. It's such a great book!
979	Mingyuan Ma	1	I think this would be a great one to read with the bookclub - lots to analyse!
980	Mingyuan Ma	1	Mine is **Inferno: A Memoir of Motherhood and Madness** by **Catherine Cho**.I added this 2 days ago to my tbr list and I can't remember where I got that from, I'm seriously getting old...In general, I follow the subs you listed as well. I love how r/52book fills my reddit with beautiful book covers. I like r/booksuggestions and r/suggestmeabook as well. I also shamelessly steal books from my goodreads friends or even their friends when they pop up in my feed. Sometimes I get books for my tbr from instagram but I don't use it that much.

983	Mingyuan Ma	2	On the ontological nature of fiction, you may want to have a look at the answers to [this post from a few months back][link] - in particular u/spolia_opima 's reply, which is full of up-to-date goodies.

986	Mingyuan Ma	2	I've read 19 books in 2022, or two books per week. Those books average 278 pages, so although there are a couple over 500 pages, they're balanced out by shorter books. Some are re-reads, which generally go more quickly. Here's the actual timing: On Sundays, my wife and I each pick a book, sit on the couch, and read, finishing the book that day (with one exception when I was busy). Then I find time during the rest of the week - a few minutes here, an hour there, it all adds up - and read something else. Sometimes one book, sometimes two, sometimes none.But the real "how" is that I remind myself that while watching TV is easier, and picking up my phone for a few minutes (which often stretch to hours) of Reddit, news, social media, etc. is easier, reading books is more pleasurable and gives me more satisfaction, and I make a point of doing it. I'm also active on r/52book, where I've set a goal and hold myself accountable through weekly check-ins on my progress. The goal isn't important, the number doesn't matter, and I don't force myself to hit an artificial target. But if I fall behind it's a reminder that there's something I should be doing that I enjoy and value more than other time-killers.
987	Mingyuan Ma	2	Literally no one gives a shit about booklists, what you’re complaining about is ideological difference. “Turning people away from our movement” in reality should read “People who are actively antithetical to our movement.” The ideological difference is that many conservatives believe in free markets, regressive social policies that reinscribe existing power structures, and controlling the bodies of women to maintain economic difference. There are longer discussions to be had about the rise of conservative populism, usually at the expense of working class folks of color, and/or the support of a police state that disproportionally incarcerated black folks, and to what degree conservatives back these policies in a shifting landscape, but for the last forty years and more, and in the rise of Trump, it’s been pretty overt.
988	Mingyuan Ma	1	unfortunately i'm reading  another book now but there is some subreddits such as /r/bookdiscussion and /r/books if you didn't find anyone to read your book with. discuss and write in Arabic so we can find other arab readers ;)

990	Mingyuan Ma	1	You deny it Did I? I said I didn't believe you. That's not the same thing.Instead of acknowledging your error you just move on to a new attack lineWhat exactly do you want me to acknowledge about a typo? It's meaningless. Which is why it's rather telling this is all you've bothered substantiating.extend the same basic courtesies of discussionI prove my points. I don't lie. I don't give you the run around (oh, but wait, you're going to complain that saying "start" isn't a specific reference to the start of the conversation and therefore you are completely right to be confused about what goalposts you're being accused on moving... except, no, it is a specific reference; this is precisely what I mean... here's a question I say I've answered but which I can easily quote you as saying I haven't answered).Elsewhere you've told me that it's my fault that you are being rude and aggressive toward me which is well, wow. Given you tried to gaslight me into believing I "came in hot"... yes, it is.Yes. "Literature" means written texts.But, sure, you win the point. Have a biscuit. Completely beside anything of substance, just like everything else you actually care to talk about, but you got me.
991	Mingyuan Ma	2	Thats great - sounds like  you should check out r/52book if you haven't already! People challenge themselves to read 52 books in a year (you can set any goal though).
992	Mingyuan Ma	1	Love the 52book sub for that reason. And my tbr grows steadily, but next up on it is The Master - a book about Roger Federer. I'm a tennis player and this was my Christmas gift :D
993	Mingyuan Ma	2	There are other subreddits more dedicated to discovering books - /r/suggestmeabook and /r/booksuggestions are very directly that, but /r/currentlyreading, /r/52books, /r/whattoreadwhen, /r/firstpage and just plain old /r/books are also possibilities. I don't think this sub needs to fill that niche also.

( I’m reading Pachinko atm, completely missed the timing of the r/bookclub even though I was so excited to join in). Read One Hundred few years ago and wanted to re-read with the classics, but Feb was interrupted by holidays and then by sickness so sadly missed all the club reads.

998	Mingyuan Ma	1	During Covid, I found r/52book and started the 1 book per week challenge. I read 65 books in 2020, but then only 52 books in 2021. This is up from 8(!) in 2019. I’m setting the same 52 book goal this year as it seems to work well for me. Unfortunately, my TBR is over 100 books long 😆
